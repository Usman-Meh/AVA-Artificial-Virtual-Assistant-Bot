"18 Chapter 1: Intellectual Background  
 
1.1 Introduction  to Artificial  Intelligence  
 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) addresses  a subset of  problems th at lend 
themselves to solution by  computers, computer programs or algorithms ."
"Often the  AI algorithms  are coupled with  the use of outside data. The 
problems in question are ones that an ideally rational and intelligent 
human being would be able to solve, given the time, resources, and 
ingenuity. One of the first examples of an AI program within librarianship"
"is that of Optical Character Recognition (OCR).  Patrons with poor vision 
might not be able to read all the books that a library contains. Yet a human 
library assistant could read books aloud or transcribe them into braille or"
"some other assistive medium. In the mid -1970s, Ray Kurzweil devised and 
assembled computing machines that did OCR and text -to-speech synthesis. 
The machines could read books aloud. Kurzweil machines are a massively 
enabling technology, removing barriers in the access to information. At"
"their core is an AI problem, the problem of recognizing text i.e. classifying 
letters, and classifying words (where those word tokens might be of 
different sizes, fonts, colors  etc.).  
 
AI in libraries should be distinguished both from automation and from the"
"plain use of computers. Libraries have been taking advantage of automat ed 
processes for almost as long as there have been libraries. For example, the 
Gutenberg  printing press , from 1440,  is a form of automation; it automates"
"the production of books and documents. Secondly , as society has benefitted"
"19 from the introduction of computers , so too have libraries. Computers -in-
Libraries is its own wide ranging and active area of study , with  conferences 
and publications. Computers -in-Libraries includes AI uses and more"
"besides. As examples o f the more besides, t he issuing and tracking of books  
typically will use computers and databases , as will the financial record 
systems for the salaries and payment of librarians.   AI in libraries is 
different  to automation and plain computing ."
"Wherein do the differences lie? The use, or simulation, of intelligence, is the 
main one. What about some further actual and potential examples from 
librarianship ? There is machine translation of texts from one natural 
language to another. There are ‘recommender’ systems that can"
"recommend books or resources to patrons. There are , or have been,  
intelligent assistants  in libraries , such as S tella, Beacon, or Bizz y, that can 
answer reference questions  and conduct reference interviews  (Sanji, 
Behzadi, and Gomroki 2022) . There are the very familiar search engines"
"and OPACs(Online Public Access Catalogs) /Discovery Systems , most of 
which have AI components. Final example: AI can add value to th e 
record ed knowledge in libraries  by extracting, synthesizing , and 
summarizing that knowledge . There is an abundance of recorded"
"knowledge in libraries. The sheer volume of the recordings would 
overwhelm a librarian or team of librarians.  Yet, t he Lithium Ion 
‘encyclopedia’ was written by a computer program running deep text 
analysis of holdings within libraries  (Writer 2019) ."
"20 AI has made massive advances in the last 30 years or so, especially in the 
areas of Machine Learning  (ML)  and Deep Learning  (DL). Both these 
approaches involve learning . Back in 1959 , Arthur Samuel wrote : 
 
… a computer can be programmed so that it will learn to play a"
"better game of checkers than can be played by the person who 
wrote the program. Furthermore, it can learn to do this … when 
given only the rules of the game, a sense of direction, and a 
redundant and incomplete list of parameters which are thought to"
"have something to do with the game, but whose correct signs and 
relative weights are unknown and unspecified. The principles of 
Machine Learning  verified by these  experiments are, of course, 
applicable to many other situations. (Samuel 1959)"
"Such programs learn by playing and by associating winning and losing with 
various strategies, moves, and tactics.  
 
A big advance came about fifty years after this, maybe around 2010, when 
the amount of data th at it was possible to gather, record, and process ,"
"expanded massively ( amounting to the so -called ‘Big Data’). It should be 
emphasized here that it is not merely the amount of data that is important, 
but also it is the ability to process that data  with a timely throughput"
"(Amodei et al. 2019) . Often this kind of  learning has similarities  to doing 
statistics with extremely large data sets . ML is distinctly different from 
other areas of AI , and the difference lies principally with the ‘learning’. For"
"example, a  while back, computer programs to diagnose  a medical condition, 
say cancer, would mimic expert doctors and consultants , perhaps  by 
attempting to extract rules governing sound or intelligent diagnoses  and 
applying those rules.  A programmer , or team of programmers,  would write"
a program to  diagnose cancer and the program  would be finished and done.
"21 It is true that some tuning might be carried out after the fact,  if the program 
was making some poor or inaccurate diagnoses. Usually , this tuning would 
consist of the programmers re -writing or changing the program, not of the"
"program modifying itself by learning. So, in general, the se program s 
themselves  did not pay a lot of attention to data that arose after they were  
written.  This style of approach is AI by ‘expert system’.  Nowadays ML 
would approach diagnoses entirely differently. There would be a ‘blank"
"slate’ program that could take in vast amounts of data, data about different 
patients, and their many and varied properties, qualities, and ‘features’, 
data about the images, and their properties , and so on.  The program would"
"be set up to focus on  the ‘ label ’ which identified  whether a patient had 
cancer or not. Then there would be a training set , which would be data 
about existing patients, and even members of the public, and known data as 
to whether they had cancer. The program would learn which features were"
"associated , or correlated,  with  (the label of)  cancer and which not. It would 
be able to predict which members of the training set had cancer (hopefully 
with a good degree of accuracy). Then, given success, the program would be"
"released  in the world at large  and applied to a test set  or test cases  i.e. real 
cases where the diagnoses are not known.  (And, possibly, results for real 
cases will be added  through time  to the training set to  improve performance"
"yet further — although care would be needed were this to be attempted. ) 
You can see how in some ways this differs from diagnoses by medical 
doctors and consultants  or by expert system . The consultants will have had 
years of training, of course, but they are not in any position to consider"
"anywhere near the number of features that a program can look at.  A DL 
program might consider thousands of features and have been trained on 
tens of thousands of cases.  Also, while some , perhaps most,  of the"
"22 consultants’ knowledge will be explicit,  some of it will be tacit (i.e. not 
articulable ). It would amount to perhaps vague  unspeakable hunches 
refined by years of experience.  Tacit knowledge is a problem for the prior 
expert system AI approach: for somehow hunches would have to be"
"converted into rules. But if the consultants  themselves  cannot put this tacit 
knowledge into words, how is this to be done? Then, going back to 
consultants,  tacit knowledge  itself  is hard to produce , instill,  and"
"disseminate. If more medical consultants are needed  in a heal th system , the 
newcomers will  have to go through an apprenticeship with an accomplished 
consultant and years of training.  Of course, r eproducing a computer"
"program can be done with the click of a mouse . A question is: which system  
is best at cancer diagnosis? With some forms of cancer, the ML programs 
provide the best diagnoses  (K. Das et al. 2021) . In sum, with cancer 
diagnoses, ML can do better than both prior AI expert systems, and human"
"doctors.   
 
Deep Learning  (DL)  is a subset of ML inspired by the human brain, in 
particular by neurons and neural nets. Neurons are nerve cells in the brain 
that can communicate with other neurons using electrical signals and"
"synapses. Specific  neurons are triggered, or become excited, and that 
activation cascades through other neurons. This provides function to the 
nervous system — to thinking, reasoning, responding, learning, paying 
attention, and other cognitive abilities . In a DL implementation , there is a"
"network o f software ‘neurons’ organized in layers. Certain levels  of 
thresholds  of input features activate  neurons in the first layer ; in turn , first 
layer activated neurons activate some neurons  in the second layer, and so"
"on through several layers. At the output level, particular  (software) units"
"23 indicate, for example, whether the patient being  diagnos ed likely has 
cancer. DL is quite involved to set up, and it is demanding on resources. 
Large amounts of data are needed, then large amounts of training time and"
"computing power to adjust the activation levels and various other ‘biases’. 
Separately, DL often can be opaque as to what is going on. By the time the 
triggering has gone through several layers , transparency can be lost  and 
that is distinctly a drawback ."
"Here is an example  (Google for Developers 2022) . A cancer diagnosis DL 
program may learn by processing images from different hospitals . But if 
one of the hospitals is specifically a cancer hospital , then that feature, if"
"used by the DL program, may result in certain types of images being given a 
higher probability of indicating cancer — those images sourced from the 
cancer hospital . And the program would be right  (those images do have a"
"higher probability  of indicating cancer ). But, really, this is being right for 
the wrong reason. Y ou want the DL program to be analyzing the images 
(supplemented perhaps with facts about the patients and their histories)"
"not reasoning from the originating hospital  of the images . To guard against 
possibilities like these, transparency  in the DL software program  helps.  You 
need to know what the program is doing , what the program is using in its 
reasoning . But DL programs can lack transparency."
"Two areas  of human intelligence  had proved  special  challenge s to AI: 
addressing text (including languages, and translation ) and addressing 
images. Hitherto, computers could not ‘understand’ or translate natural 
languages, and they could not recognize  and process  images , including"
"24 videos,  as sources of information. Machine learning and DL have changed 
that: text and images are now fair game for AI.  
 
AI as a scholarly discipline covers many different areas. But for the 
purposes of the cascade of recent  AI developments , and of AI in libraries,"
"we can focus on ML and DL.  
 
1.2 A Genuine  Great Leap Forward  
 
A great leap forward came from Transformers, Large Language Models, 
and Foundation Models. At the end of  November 2022, ChatGPT was 
released to the public . By January  2023 , it had 100 million active users ."
"Many more  interested observers  were aware of its existence — more than 
40% of the adults in the United States know about it.  It is the fastest 
growing, and most widely used, software application of all time . There is"
"some  history to it. In 2017 , Ashish Vaswani and co -authors published the 
paper Attention is all you need  (Vaswani et al. 2017)  (see also (Huang et al. 
2018) ). This introduced Transformers. Shortly thereafter there started to"
"emerge Large Language Models and Foundation Models. (What all these 
are will be explained later in the book.)  ChatGPT is a Transformer, and a 
Large Language Model, and initially it was a fine-tuned version of the 
Foundation Models GPT -3 and GPT -3.5. (As of 7/1/2024, ChatGPT uses 
GPT -4o.)"
"Pretty much any machine learning or deep learning program can be built 
from a Foundation Model (that is why they are called 'Foundation Models'). 
Also, t he results of systems built using Foundation Models will likely be"
"25 superior to any other approach. So , a correct strategy in solving a machine 
learning problem is to address  it using a Foundation Model . But 
Foundation Model s themselves are very expensive, and resource needy, to 
create. We are talking here o f hundreds of millions of dollars, months of"
"computing time, and of using a large portion of the internet as data. Only a 
few large commercial companies have been able to produce the b iggest and 
best of the Foundation Models. Producing Foundation Models is not the"
"sort of thing that you and I are going to do, nor are most universities, nor 
even most governments. Some Foundation models have been open -sourced  
and are freely available to all . This is a mixed blessing . Allowing 
programmer/users to have the code, lets them see what the code is and ,"
"historically, with open -sourced projects like Linux, the programmers can 
contribute, improve the code, 'catch bugs', etc. But  Foundation model ML 
code is a little different. There are deep security concerns and great 
potential for unintentional, and even intentional, harm. Trusting a few"
"massive companies like Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft to look after us is 
not brilliant, but it is probably better than making the code available to all 
and sundry (including bad actors). That said, the massive company Meta"
"open -sources its code. Also, Hugging Face provides a hub, a library of open -
source Foundation Models  (Hugging Face 2023) . Some commercial 
Foundation Models  have Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that 
allow Users  to pay a fee and use them  (for now at least ). For example, May"
"2023, from (OpenAI 2022c) , you can pay $20 a month and have good API 
access to GPT -4."
"26 From an educational point  of view, we can take a machete and cleave out  
and discard  pretty much all of machine learning prior to Foundation 
Models and start our studies  at that point. Andrej Karpathy writes : 
 
… the whole setting of training a neural network from scratch on"
"some target task (like digit recognition) is quickly becoming 
outdated due to finetuning, especially with the emergence of 
foundation models like GPT. These foundation models are trained 
by only a few institutions with substantial computing resources,"
"and most applications are achieved via lightweight finetuning of 
part of the network, prompt engineering, or an optional step of 
data or model distillation into smaller, special -purpose inference 
networks. I think we should expect this trend to be very much"
"alive, and indeed, intensify. In its most extreme extrapolation, you 
will not want to train any neural networks at all. (Karpathy 
2023b)  
 
1.3 Digitization  and Transcription  
 
Digital computers work with electronic digits, surprise. They work with the"
"digits 0s and 1. But, unfortunately, at least some of the information 
resources that the ML algorithms have the potential to  address are not , or 
were not,  in digital form.  For example, Shakespeare’s only surviving 
playscript — The Booke of Sir Thomas Moore — was not  (British Library"
"2020) . So, digitization of those resources not born digital is an important 
precursor to wide -ranging ML in librarianship.  
 
The 2002  Google Books Project,  or Google Project Ocean, was a very early 
attempt to address digitization.  Its approach was to use OCR scanning on"
"the physical resources. It was not prompted by the needs of ML, rather it 
was aiming for a Universal Library. As James Somers writes :"
"27  
You were going  to get one -click access to the full text of nearly 
every book that’s ever been published. Books still in print you’d 
have to pay for, but everything else —a collection slated to grow  
larger than the holdings at the Library of Congress, Harvard, the"
"University of Michigan, at any of the great national libraries of 
Europe —would have been available for free at terminals that were 
going to be placed in every local library that wanted one.  
At the terminal you were going to be able to search tens of"
"millions of books and read every page of any book you found. 
You’d be able to highlight passages and make annotations and 
share them; for the first time, you’d be able to pinpoint an idea 
somewhere inside the vastness of the printed record, and send"
"somebody straight to it with a link. Books would become as 
instantly available, searchable, copy -pasteable —as alive in the 
digital world —as web pages.  (Somers 2017)  
 
There is another huge potential benefit that arises from  the network effects"
"of having many books digitized collectively. The Google Page Rank 
algorithm, which the core of its very successful search engine for the web , 
uses links between  web pages to establish ranking. Something similar, 
citation indexing, citation counting, and citation ranking , had long been in"
"use in  bibliometrics and informetrics working with  paper based libraries  
(Dizikes 2011; Araújo, Castanha, and Hjørland 2021) . If books, journals, 
and other paper -based resources were also to be available digitally,  
powerful algorithms using linking then  could be used  in conjunction with"
"massive compute power — search and ranking  of actual books in libraries  
would be able to be improved.  So, the promise was of a Universal Library, 
with improved  search and ranking of the sources.  
 
Unfortunately, the Google Book P roject got mired in difficulties of one kind"
"or another, mainly legal, and, as of 202 3, it seems to have drifted off into"
"28 limbo  (Somers 2017; Howard 2017) . The work does continue, but in a 
somewhat slower and piecemeal fashion.  We cannot pretend that this is a 
good result, but modern practices have rendered it less of a total disaster 
than it might have been. Most published books today are written on word"
"processors on computers. Even if they are not produced that way, they are 
usually in electronic form prior to being printed (if, indeed, they are 
printed). The authors or publishers may or may not make the electronic 
form available to the world at large.  Authors write books to have them read."
"Publishers ‘print’ books to have them read  (and sold or licensed) . The 
parties concerned have incentives.  So, one way or another, these electronic 
forms should become available.  
 
Separately, physical documents  themselves  are perhaps not so important as"
"they once were. The indexed Web is around 60 billion pages (de Kunder 
2022) , and Google estimated that the number of physical books they 
needed to scan was around 130 million.  The Web, the Internet, is a lot 
larger than the combined book collections in libraries."
"There is a distinction or consideration that should be mentioned here: that 
between digitization and transcription  (or decoding) . Were we to use a 
modern smartphone to take  images  of Shakespeare’s The Booke of Sir 
Thomas Moore we would have the playscript in digital form. But the"
"playscript  itself  is in  letters, words, sentences, and in speeches. It has 
structure. It is that structure , or some or most of it,  that we would like 
captured digital form. When Google set out on their book project, they did"
"not aim to photograph every page of every book. They aimed to  use Optical 
Character Recognition ( OCR ) to get to the structure d text in digital form  as"
"29 0s and 1s . They aimed to transcribe to  digitiz ed computer text  that could be 
copied, pasted, read aloud, tran slated to other languages, etc. It is that 
structured digitization that is the desired goal. ML can usually work with a"
"digital image of a text and do an OCR extraction of structured text. But, 
nowadays, when authors are writing on word processors, and publishers 
are using the digitized form throughout the workflow , structured 
digitization should be available without  having use  OCR  on images ."
"Many libraries have digital collections, for example the Library of Congress 
has https://www.loc.gov/collections/  with millions and millions of items. 
Its collection Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers  has"
"over 20 million images (i.e. photographs) of pages of  historical newspapers. 
That is great, but for certain kinds of research those need to be transcribed 
into the 0s and 1s of computer  text. (Very shortly machine learning will be 
able to do that task in the blink of an eye.)"
"1.4 A Paean to Text in Structured Digital Form  
 
Having text in digital form is very valuable in terms of what can be done 
with it. Here are some possibilities. (There may be some overlap between 
the categories.)  
 
1.4.1 Text -to-Speech"
"(Computer) text can be spoken aloud. That is one part of what the Kurzweil 
machines, mentioned above, do. This is not trivial, by any manner of 
means, but it is also not a challenging AI problem.  Obviously, text -to-"
"30 speech computer programs need to know the language of the text and how 
it is to be spoken (its pronunciation).  
 
1.4.2 Machine Translation  
 
Computer t ext, from a source natural  language, can be translated by 
computer into other languages. This used to be done in an expert systems"
"style of AI. There would be a dictionary between the source and target 
languages, grammar rules for both languages, and programmers would try 
to figure out translation rules that algorithms could use to get from one 
language to the other. The modern approach would be to used ML and DL."
"This relies on existing (human) translations between texts. These come 
from a variety of sources; for example, the United Nations provides 
translations into six languages of all its texts. The Bible has been translated 
into many languages, although it does have the drawback of having a very"
"specific and distinctive written style. Google Translate uses the DL program 
‘Google Neural Machine Translation’. At a first cut, this is what it does. 
There are a number of texts that have been translated , by human 
translators,  from one language to another, say from English to French (and"
"French to English). To translate from English to French the Neural D.L. will 
find all the existing occurrences of the relevant sentence, phrase, or word, 
in English and look up how they been translated by the human translators."
"Then it will favor what seems to be the best translation. Making the latter 
judgement depends also on what the D.L. has learned, supplementary rules, 
dictionaries, etc."
"31 The resulting translations are reasonable, but not perfect. (They can be 
improved by further editing by human readers or translators.) You can see 
where some of the problems may lie. Context is one. Single words might be"
"homographs (for example, ‘bank’ (financial institution) and ‘bank’ (side of a 
river)) and the translation system might lack the context to disambiguate 
them. Plain lack of understanding may be another. Human translators 
presumably will understand their translation, and this would prevent"
"certain kinds of ridiculousness. In a general way, a neural DL will learn 
what is silly and what is not. But still, i n no sense does it understand the 
text, and this leaves open to making certain kinds of mistakes (i.e. those"
"where the words, grammar, and construction are all fine but the result is 
nonsense).  
 
Douglas Hofstadter offers interesting examples , including : 
 
In their house, everything comes in pairs. There’s his car and her 
car, his towels and her towels, and his library and hers."
"(Hofstadter 2018)  
 
As of 2023, machine translation simply cannot translate this correctly, say 
from English to Frenc h. An anecdote. The author's  wife had some dental 
treatment while  living in Japan.  The Japanese  hygienist had a little device"
"that she spoke into in  Japanese , and it spoke back in English. So, this is 
digitization and transcription of speech, translation of one language to 
another, then speaking aloud the resulting translation. Here  is a real 
example of what it said to her:"
"Pardon me, may I please put red dye on your dirty teeth!"
"32  
Despite the occasional oddity, machine translation can work 24 hours a 
day, 7 days a week on a vast number of sources. It is not expensive. In sum, 
machine translation can produce a bulk of translations of reasonable 
quality.  Progress in this area is rapid for example, Ankur Bapna and co -"
"authors have a paper Building Machine Translation Systems for the Next 
Thousand Languages  (Bapna et al. 2022) . 
 
1.4.3 Search and Navigation  
  
Once a text is in digital form it can be searched and navigated very 
efficiently, even if it has no preemptively prepared index. For example, the"
"words 'butterflies' and 'rhopalocera'  are synonyms, and 'lepidoptera' is a 
term for an order of insects that includes rhopalocera (i.e. it is a more 
general term). Imagine yourself to be a young person with a physical book 
on the subject of insects. You are interested in the specific topic of"
"butterflies. But perhaps the word 'butterflies' is not in the index of the book, 
nor does it appear frequently in the text if at all (although 'rhopalocera' 
appears many times, being the favored word of the synonym pair). Also, on"
"this occasion, you are interested more widely in insects. You would like 
your search to include butterflies but  also, in part,  to be a little more 
general. Basically, you will be disappointed with what you are able to"
"achieve (which will be more -or-less nothing). In contrast, were the book to 
be digitized and it were searched by computer ( either with Large Language 
Model, or with thesaurus support), the desired tasks and goal would be 
trivial and satisfiable in milliseconds."
"33  
 
1.4.4 Preservation  and Archiving  
 
Loss of the contents of some texts could be catastrophic — for example, 
contracts, treaties, or the works of Shakespeare. Once digitized,  once there 
is a digital surrogate,  there are cryptographic techniques to preserve text"
"surrogates  'forever'. They could be encrypted, hashed, and put into a 
suitable public blockchain using content -based indexing. Alternatively, one 
digital copy could be placed in the Billion Year Archive  through the good 
graces of the Arch Mission Foundation (Spivak and Slavin 2023) ."
"1.4.5 Free Books!  
 
Once text is in digital form the marginal cost of duplication is near zero. Of 
course, there are considerations of licensing and intellectual property . 
 
1.4.6 Natural Language Processing  
 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) has always used  0s and 1s and"
"computers. But it has absolutely flourished with ML, and especially with  
Large Language Models  (which we will discuss later ). As a selection of 
possible procedures or techniques, there is: the entire field of digital"
"34 humanities, text summarization, text mining, question answering, 
information extraction, text categorization, sentiment analysis, plagiarism 
detection, author and genre recognition, word sense disambiguation, and 
lexical and ontological acquisition, and text analysis for social applications"
"such as blogs and social networks.  So, for example, given two physical texts 
by unknown authors and the question 'are these texts written by the same 
author?', digitization and NLP can provide the answer.  
 
1.4.7 Processing by Computer Software"
"Much data either exists or was initially recorded on a physical medium, 
such as paper or cards. This data really needs to be digitized in order to be 
processed by statistics or data science. This processing would then amount 
to data processing, or data mining, or text data mining (TDM). Vast"
"continents  of knowledge or information  would be opened up . 
 
1.5 Data and the Need for Good Data  
 
ML aims to learn, and what it is going to learn from is data. Primarily this 
data is the encoding of observational or experiential reports about the"
"world . At one point, historically, such data would have been assumed to be 
a solid bedrock. Nowadays, most philosophers of science would describe 
observation reports, or  data  of this kind , as being 'theory -laden'. Really ,"
"they are two aspects to this  assertion . Any observation report  relies on 
theories which infuse either the instruments used or the raw observa tions"
"35 (if there is any such thing as truly raw observations ) (Duhem 1914; Hanson 
1958) . Duhem writes : 
 
Go into this laboratory; draw near this table crowded with so 
much apparatus: an electric battery, copper wires wrapped in silk,"
"vessels filled with mercury, coils, a small iron bar carrying a 
mirror. An observer plunges the metallic stem of a rod, mounted 
with rubber, into small holes; the iron oscillates and, by means of 
the mirror tied to it, sends a beam of light over to a celluloid ruler,"
"and the observer follows the movement of the light beam on it. 
There, no doubt, you have an experiment; by means of the 
vibration of this spot of light, the physicist minutely observes the 
oscillations of the piece of iron.  
Ask him now what he is doing. Is he going to answer “I am"
"studying the oscillations of the piece of iron carrying this mirror?” 
No, he will tell you that he is measuring the electrical resistance of 
a coil. If you are astonished and ask him what meaning these 
words have, and what relation they have to the phenomena he has"
"perceived and which you have at the same time perceived, he will 
reply that your question would require some very long 
explanations, and he will recommend that you take a course in 
electricity.  
It is indeed the case that the experiment that you have seen done,"
"like any experiment in physics, involves two parts. In the first 
place it consists in the observation of certain facts… In the second 
place, it consists in the interpretation of those facts…  
The result of the operations in which an experimental physicist is"
"engaged is by no means the perception of a group of concrete 
facts; it is the formation of a judgement interrelating certain 
abstract and symbolic ideas which theories alone correlate with 
the facts really observed  (Duhem 1914) ."
"A consequence of this is that the reports are conjectural, or fallible. Any of 
them may be mistaken. They are not a bedrock. Second, any collection of 
data is a selection among what it is possible to observe or measure. The 
philosopher of science Karl Popper wr ites:"
"36 … the belief that we can start with pure observation alone, without 
anything in the nature of a theory is absurd; as may be illustrated 
by the story of the man who dedicated his life to natural science, 
wrote down everything he could observe, and bequeathed his"
"priceless collection of observations to the Royal Society to be used 
as evidence. This story should show us that though beetles may 
profitably be collected, observations may not.  
 
Twenty -five years ago I tried to bring home the same point to a"
"group of physics students in Vienna by beginning a lecture with 
the following instructions: 'Take pencil and paper; carefully 
observe, and write down what you have observed!' They asked, of 
course, what I wanted them to observe. Clearly the instruction,"
"'Observe!' is absurd. (It is not even idiomatic, unless the object of 
the transitive verb can be taken as understood.) Observation is 
always selective. It needs a chosen object, a definite task, an 
interest, a point of view, a problem. And its description"
"presupposes a descriptive language, with property words; it 
presupposes similarity and classification, which in their turn 
presuppose interests, points of view, and problems  (Popper 1963) . 
 
So, the data used in ML is always incomplete."
"It is becoming increasingly common in ML circles to use the phrases 
'ground truth' or 'ground truths' or 'ground truth data set'. Caution is 
needed here. No matter how much care goes into gathering and curating 
the data , it can still be wrong and incomplete."
"There are many other pitfalls that can occur sample data or training data 
even if the data  is absolutely correct . The data may be 'unbalanced'. An 
example that can be used here is that of a test predicting the (unknown) 
gender of a person from their (known) height. If the training data, the"
"sample, where the heights and genders are known , consists of 95% males"
"37 and 5%  females, then mathematics will suggest predicting male no matter 
what the height of the test subject is.  
 
In sum, getting good training data is tricky.  
 
1.6 Types of Machine Learning  
 
1.6.1 Supervised  
 
Supervised learning is learning with a teacher — a teacher who knows the"
"answers. An example will help here: Optical Character Recognition (OCR). 
OCR is a solution a supervised ‘classification problem’. It can look at some 
text e.g. ‘Call me Ishmael’ and identify, or recognize, that the first letter of"
"the text is a ‘C’, the second letter is an ‘a’, and so on. ML OCR will approach 
this by being taught how to classify characters. It will be supplied with a 
training set , which will be a reasonable sample of le tters and the correct"
"classifications  of what they are. Training sets are typically  large. For 
example, the well -known and widely used MNIST set, which is a collection 
of hand -written examples of the digits 0 through 9, with correct 
identification labels, has around 60,000 entries (LeCun, Cortes, and Burges"
"1998) . The overall OCR technique is an optical one, so it is the features of 
the sample letters that can be detected optically that will be the input (e.g. 
size, shape, color, grid arrangement of component dots or pixels, etc.). Then"
"the program will attempt to correlate combinations (i.e. vectors) of these 
with the correct classification e.g. that a particular sample token character 
is an ‘a’. More than likely, the program will make many mistakes initially."
"38 But either the programmers, or the program itself, will tune various 
parameters (e.g. weights on the components of the vectors) to improve the 
classification until it reaches an acceptable level of performance. There is"
"an interesting point to be made here about what are known in statistics as 
'omitted variables '. As mentioned, the ML program will start by considering 
optical input from size, color, pixels etc. But it will then learn which"
"variables of these to include and which to omit. The machine here has an 
advantage over a human statistician as it has the sheer computing power to 
run through the alternative possibilities in a reasonable time.  
 
The training set needs to be adequate for the task. For example, if the letter"
"‘j’ does not appear in the training set, it is unreasonable to expect the ML 
program to classify js correctly. Even if js appear, there needs to be enough 
of them in the various fonts and scripts (cursive or not, monospaced or"
"proportional, etc.) for the program to be able to learn what is correct and 
what is not. OCR, i.e. recognizing the actual individual characters, would 
not usually be an end in itself. Rather, the interest would be in the words 
that those characters form, or, more generally, the text."
"If the OCR, or Text Recognition, application has access to a wider context of 
text, that can improve its performance. For example, if the ML is 
recognizing entire words from their component characters, and separators,"
"then the first letter of the word ‘On’ is going to be the letter upper case ‘O’ 
and not the numeric letter zero ‘0’ — the number zero makes no sense in 
that context."
"39 Supervised learning needs labeled data for its training data. Getting such 
data with quality and in quantity is not easy. Often experts will be required 
to do the labeling e.g. of medical images, or of the correct cataloging 
numbers for books in libraries. But many  experts would struggle if"
"confronted with 100,000 items to label. Sometimes the process can be 
eased, at a financial cost, by crowdsourcing (Wikipedia 2023c) . For 
example, the LaMDA models of dialog agents uses crowdsourcing, where 
the members of the crowd are supplied with calculators and access to a web"
"browser and a search engine so they can check how reliable the output 
information is that the dialog agents supply (Thoppilan et al. 2022) . 
 
1.6.2 Unsupervised  
 
The word ‘supervised’ comes in to qualify learning because it is known, for"
"most of the cases, what the correct answers are. A Machine Learner could, 
alternatively, be challenged to classify marks (characters) on paper into 
groups of marks (characters) similar to other characters i.e. clustering 
(forming clusters of similar characters). That would be unsupervised"
"learning, where there are no known right or wrong answers (and no 
teacher).  
 
A first issue here is that there is no ML constraint as to how many clusters 
there might be, or should be, in any given problem. For example, the music"
"streamer Spotify plays songs that the listener wishes to listen to; Spotify can 
cluster these songs into similar songs and perhaps mark those as being 
‘playlists’ or ‘radio stations’; then the User can listen to a radio station while"
"40 cooking, or while going for a walk etc. But the clustering algorithm needs to 
know ‘how many radio stations should there be: 2 stations, 7 stations, 
300…?’ There is no answer to that question from within the ML system. 
Spotify itself, or the User, or some outside party, has to decide on the"
"number of stations. Going back to OCR  and attempting to do it in an 
unsupervised fashion. We could help it by saying we would like 36 clusters 
(we have in mind here one for each letter of the alphabet, and for each 
digit). Clustering might then lead to mistakes like characters that we"
"consider to be upper case ‘I’s being put together with lower case ‘l’s or zeros 
‘0’ with upper case ‘O’s. There is no training set. There are no right or 
wrong answers available to assess the program. Unsupervised classification"
"might be perfect in certain areas, for example, clustering songs into 
playlists, but it is not really suitable for OCR.  
 
1.6.3 Semi -Supervised  
 
Supervised and unsupervised classification approaches can be combined. 
This might be useful when there is a huge amount of data, of which only a"
"small proportion is ‘labeled’ (i.e. it is known what those items are), and the 
process of labeling is expensive or time consuming  or hard to do . For 
example: - imagine some historical biodiversity researchers who collected"
"specimen samples in the style of Darwin; they also did as much labeling as 
they could manage, including labeling at least one example of what they 
thought was every species they came across; then the initially unlabeled 
specimens were later to be donated to many museums, who, of course,"
"wanted them labeled; this problem might be approached by clustering,"
"41 supplemented with a back -and-forth with supervised learning; then the 
final labeling of the museum samples could be done by machine.  
 
 
1.6.4 Self -Supervised  
 
The learning techniques mention ed to date have problems and issues."
"Supervised learning required large amounts of labeled data which is often 
difficult, expensive, or even near impossible, to obtain. The need for the 
quality labeling is the cause of the problem. Unsupervised learning simply 
might not give you what you want."
"Self-supervised Learning  (SSL)  is an ingenious idea which will often be far 
superior to its alternatives. Basically, it uses unsupervised learning, and the 
data itself, to label the data, then it uses supervised learning on the now"
"labeled data. To do this the data has to have suitable structure or patterns 
in it.  This gives a context, or contexts to items of data, and the general 
problem being addressed needs to be tightly specified or understood. SSL 
really found its place in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and some"
"examples from NLP may make the technique clearer. The foundation 
models BERT and GPT -3 both have the pre -training task of predicting the 
next word, or previous word, from a sequence of words in a passage of 
English (or other natural languages) (Devlin et al. 2019; Brown et al. 2020) ."
"The way they do it is to scan vast amounts of English text e.g. trillions of 
word tokens such as the entire of the Internet (including Wikipedia, Reddit 
linked sources, all freely available digitized novels, etc.).  Apparently GPT -3"
"42 was pre -trained on 45 terabytes of data. This is about the same size as one 
quarter of the holdings of the Library of Congress.  This  pre-training  
provides the various transition probabilities from prefix, or suffix, words or"
"sequences, to the current target word, and, essentially, the solution. Now, 
the data itself, the English text, is not labeled, so this is not supervised 
learning. But the scanning of the text can produce a pseudo -label for the"
"missing 'gap word'. For example, the label for 'The cat sat on the <?label?> ' 
can be produced merely by looking through a vast amount of real -life text. 
Of course, there does not have to be a single one -word answer to this. 'mat',"
"'table', 'floor', etc. might all be possible answers. But then there will be 
probabilities associated with the possible answers, and the wider context 
will provide guidance.  
 
Self-supervised learning has an obvious home with natural language. But it"
"also can be used with images. There is a context to which patches of colors 
or pixels are close to other patches. Further, foundation models like GPT -3, 
GPT -4, etc.,  are becoming multi -modal. ‘Multi -modal’ means that they can"
"work with different ‘modes’ such as with text, images, audio, video, etc.. 
The earlier technique for this was to use text as a stepping -stone. The model  
would  be pre -trained, using SSL on text, then fine -tuned, perhaps with"
"some prompts or labeling, to work on images. Nowadays, many Foundation 
Models can work with different modes natively, without using text as an 
intermediary step. SSL offers freedom. Getting good, labeled data at scale is"
"difficult, if not near impossible. It is a barrier or bottleneck. But with SSL, it 
is not needed."
"43 1.6.5 Reinforcement  
 
Reinforcement learning is familiar to us in daily life. It involves exploration 
of an environment by trial -and-error, and, as part of this, having what are 
called 'delayed rewards' (Sutton and Barto 2018) . The rewards provide"
"feedback as to how well the trial -and-error is working. Imagine a student 
backpacker having temporary employment picking apples in an orchard. 
She gets paid for each apple she picks (but for each apple she picks there"
"will be one less apple to pick on the tree that she picked it from). Also, she 
gets a bonus for each basket of apples that she picks, especially if she fills 
the basket faster than other pickers. Bigger apples will fill a basket quicker,"
"but there will be fewer  of them in the basket. We will assume here that she 
is trying to maximize her pay, i.e. her rewards. Quite what her best picking 
strategy might be is a bit of a question. She presumably will have to change"
"trees from time to time, but changing trees is not actually picking. It 
amounts to dead time invested in the hope of higher rewards later. She will 
also have to pay attention to other pickers, and to the simple nature of the"
"individual trees. If she works in the orchard for several days, she should be 
able to learn of a reasonable strategy by trial -and-error i.e. by trying a few 
approaches and favoring those yielding higher total rewards. The whole 
process amounts to reinforcement learning."
"Reinforcement learning can be used when the ML system has to  make a 
sequence of tasks, or moves, or steps towards some desired goal and there 
are rewards or penalties for successes or failures. While learning, the 
system will typically be allowed to try the overall task of reaching the goal"
"44 many times. Games are a good setting for this e.g. Tic -Tac-Toe or Checkers 
or Chess. There will be an environment, and possibly permitted moves 
governed by rules. The system will be rewarded or penalized according to 
whether a particular move is judged to be good and also, perhaps, whether"
"the system wins or loses the game overall. The system is not programmed 
with any strategy or tactics, rather it explores the game by trial and error.  
Another example of reinforcement learning would be a robot exploring an 
environment e.g. finding a route through a maze."
"Reinforcement learning is not supervised learning — there is no labeled 
data. It also is not unsupervised learning or self -supervised learning. It is a 
sui generis  ML technique — one that needs to have some reward structure."
"It certainly can be used in language settings. For example, an ML program 
might be configured to produce five different translations of the same text; 
then if these could be ranked, perhaps by a human judge; then the rankings"
"could be used as a reward structure, and a reinforcement learning system 
introduced improve the system at translating. Sometimes, in this context, 
the reward structure is called the 'reward model'. Typically, reinforcement"
"learning is very compute intensive — e.g. for chess, the ML system may need 
to play hundreds of thousands of games. There are many algorithms to 
produce reinforcement learning, but few, if any, are efficient in really large"
"settings. Supposedly, one of the technologies that enabled some of the uses 
of Foundation  Models, such as ChatGPT, was the invention of Proximal 
Policy Optimization (OpenAI 2017) . Proximal Policy Optimization is a 
reinforcement learning algorithm."
"45 1.6.6 Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)  
Modern Foundation Models or Large Language Models often use 
Reinforcement Learning in a very specific way. The training of these takes 
place in two stages: the initial training to produce  a plain vanilla base"
"model, then Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)  is 
used  to yield the desired product. A textual base model might be produced 
by self-supervised training on most  of the text on the Internet. This might 
take months to do , and the result might be able to write presentable"
"English. But the model might  at that point  lack some desirable qualities 
(such as answering questions given by prompts) and might possess some 
undesirable properties (such as lying, giving poor medical advice , revealing"
"private information). The model will  then  be tuned using RLHF. A jury of 
perhaps 40 people  will be assembled and given maybe 10,000 samples of 
pairs of answers from the model. Each member of the jury will evaluate the 
answers, saying which of a pair is  better and which worse. Then, those"
"evaluations will be fed back to the model  as additional training. The model 
will adjust itself according ly. 
 
One point of importance about RLHFs is that as the models get really big, 
as they are going to, RLHF becomes impossible as a practicality. If a model"
"were to produce a billion responses, no human jury would be able to 
evaluate them.  In 2024, RLHF has been one difference between success 
and failure with Foundation Models. But it is not going to work in its 
present form going forward."
"46 [There are plenty of companies advertising on the Internet for (paid) RLHF 
jury participants. Try ‘ advertisements for RLHF participants ’ in a Google or 
Perplexity search.]  
 
 
1.7 The Concept of Algorithm  
 
Programmers , mathematicians,  and computer scientists regard algorithms"
"as finite sequences of steps or instructions to perform a computation. The 
instructions themselves are considered to be atomic, or not in need of 
further breakdown or explanation. The earliest algorithms are from about 
three and a half thousand years ago. Here is one from that period to do"
"division of integers by repeated subtraction. It is assumed that we can 
determine whether one number is smaller than another, that we can 
subtract one number from another, and that we can count the number of 
subtractions that we have done. Then the divisor is repeatedly subtracted"
"until the remainder is less than the divisor. Finally, the quotient  (the 
'result') is the number of subtractions that have been made. For example, to 
determine the quotient  when 22 is divided by 4  (which we all know to be 5) : 
 
22-4 = 18  
22-4-4 = 14  
22-4-4-4 = 10  
22-4-4-4-4=6"
"22-4-4-4-4-4 =2 /* and 2 is less than 4*/  
5 subtractions have been made so the quotient when 22 is divided 
by 4 is 5 ."
"47 [This algorithm is taught in 3rd grade school mathematics. ] The act of 
programming is using a computer programming language to assemble 
instructions into algorithms. Usually, this process will be modularized. 
Small algorithms will be created, as components or modules. Then these"
"algorithmic modules will be combined to produce a complex artifact. The 
end result might be described as being an 'algorithm', but, given sufficient 
complexity, the plain moniker 'computer program' might be more suitable."
"Google's Internet Services consist of 2 billion lines of code; Microsoft's 
Office Suite for the Mac consists of 30 million lines of code (Desjardins 
2017) . It would be very strange for programmers or computer scientists to"
"describe either of these as being 'algorithms'. They are computer programs 
or collections of computer programs.  
 
The word 'algorithm' has become transmogrified in recent times. The 
vernacular has taken a different turn. Where there is no apparent human"
"agency in a computer program , or computer supported service , that affects 
humans , folk can and do ascribe the agency to an 'algorithm' or 
'algorithms'. For example, nowadays a mortgage company will typically use 
data, computers, and algorithms to determine whether we might qualify for"
"a loan. If we are turned down , we might well say that the mortgage 
company's 'algorithm', the algorithm itself , declared us ineligible for one of 
their loans. This attribution is not quite right, we will go into that further in 
Section 7.5."
"There is a n important detail in connection with algorithms in the context of 
ML. It is that algorithms can change or self -adjust or self -adapt when faced 
with (training) data.  The ML  programs learn by changing  their algorithms."
"48 The same beginning , template, or seed algorithm when confronted with two 
different sets of training data can produce two different trained outcome 
algorithms. Perhaps that is not a surprise. One would expect different 
learning from different data to learn from. This  adaptation  is a small"
"change from  how historical algorithms typically behaved, and it can mean , 
in particular cases , that it is unclear or unknown as to which algorithm is 
actually running  after learning . In turn, this can shroud some or many of"
"the processes in  a fog (i.e. in  black boxes ). This is exactly the opposite of 
what desirable. Transparency is valuable both for ethical reasons (for 
example, when making decisions involving humans) and for technical 
reasons (for example, when trying to assess the correctness of the"
"programs).  Part of the lack of transparency comes from the plain 
complexity of the systems. Some of the ML systems might have a billion 
parameters or more — then it becomes hard to know what the values for the 
parameters are and how they interact.  There is another word or label that"
"gets used in this context and that is 'model'. When an ML system is trained 
and its initial algorithm adapts and changes into another algorithm, known 
or unknown, transparent or hidden, the end result is often called the 
'model'.

Chapter 2: Chatbots  
 
2.1 Introduction  
 
The word 'chatbots' is commonly used in AI as a label for Dialog Agents. In 
turn, dialog agents might be chit -chat agents or task -oriented agents 
(Daniel Jurafsky and Martin 2021) . Chit -chat agents are understood to be"
"software systems that can 'chat' with you. They chat by interchanging text 
messages or by using sound and speaking and listening. There is no special 
purpose to these chats, apart from entertainment, engagement, and 
perhaps companionship. Task -oriented dialog agents also have interactive"
"sequential conversations. But they can do more (and do less). For example, 
in a general setting, they can book an airline ticket, order a taxi or a meal, 
set an alarm or timer, produce a recipe for a birthday cake, retrieve"
"information resources, offer instruction etc. Most everybody is familiar with 
Apple's Siri, or Window’s Cortan a, or Amazon's Alexa, or OK Google, which 
are such agents.  These are used on many devices including, most obviously, 
smartphones."
"The task -oriented agents can do less in the following sense. They are 
directed to one  task , or sometimes more,  and this really limits the 
possibilities they have to face. For example, an airline ticket agent needs to"
"be able to 'chat' about departures, destinations, and flight times, but it does 
not need to be able to chit -chat about the novels of Toni Morrison, last 
night's baseball game, and how to cure a shank at golf."
"51  
There is a suggestion that chatbots may partially replace browsing of 
certain kinds of web pages. For example, a library home page may have a  
lot of information on it about the various services or resources that the 
library offers, navigation through this may be eased by assistance from a"
"chatbot.  
 
2.2 Dialog Processing  
 
Among the hallmarks of natural dialogs are unexpected and 
seemingly  unpredictable sequences of events. (Bobrow et al. 1977)  
 
It is valuable to have some appreciation of what a dialog is, and how"
"difficult it is model it using software and Natural Language Processing  
(NLP) . We will make simplifications here.  
 
A dialog is a communication that takes place between two or more 
participants. For us, this can be two participants: one of which is a human,"
"and the other a computer (or software system). At the beginning of the 
dialog, one of the participants has the initiative  or control . This means that 
they set the initial agenda, assumptions, and common understandings that 
are required for the dialog to get underway. There are different"
"conversational settings, as examples, talking about Xmas gifts for children 
has di fferent assumptions to that of discussing the best recipe for a bund t 
cake, or to that of booking an airline ticket. Of course, a single conversation"
"can range over many settings. As a dialog progresses, it may be that the 
agent with the initiative retains it throughout. An example here would that"
"52 of a commercial telephone answering and routing system. The caller can 
make choices among the options on offer, but the caller cannot ask 
questions or offer choices to the system. More usual are dialogs of mixed 
initiative , where control is sometimes with one agent and sometimes with"
"the other. This usually would be the case with airline ticket reservation 
systems. The participants can take turns at having the initiative, but also 
one can retain the initiative through several interactions (for example, with"
"a sequence of yes/no questions). How the initiative might be transferred 
from one to the other is a complex array of possibilities. There are a 
number of explicit conversational practices, but also there are implicit 
conventions (e.g. pauses). Also, an important consideration is whether"
"there are visual or non -verbal cues (as there might be with 
videoconferencing). There are indexicals, such as 'I', 'now', 'yesterday', etc. 
Just what these might refer on a particular occasion to is a bit of a question."
"The computer saying 'I' will have a different reference to the human saying 
'I'. But also the indexicals might change their reference as the conversation 
progresses and the initiative changes. 'Three days earlier' might refer to"
"different times at different points in the conversation. Sometimes the 
notion of anaphora is introduced here. Anaphora is where the 
interpretation or reference of one expression depends on another; for 
example, in 'John Smith is conscientious. He often works evenings.' the"
"word 'he' is anaphoric for 'John Smith'. The computer can avoid anaphora 
(perhaps at the cost of having a somewhat stilted and unusual 
conversational style) by always making the references explicit (e.g. saying 
'John Smith' instead of 'he'). However, there is no controlling what the"
human might do.
"53 Further, there is conversational implicature (studied extensively by the 
philosopher H.P. Grice) (Davis 2019) . This is where speaker meaning is 
different to sentence meaning (and similar related phenomena). Consider 
an example from (Davis 2019) : 
 
Alan: Are you going to Paul’s party?"
"Barb: I have to work.  
 
The meaning of the sentence that Barb says is that she has to work. The 
sentence itself  does not have any kind of meaning like 'not going to a party'. 
However, her use of this sentence on this occasion means she is not going"
"to Paul's party. There is a conversational implicature to that effect. So, for 
example, if a chatbot is collecting RSVPs to Paul's party, it needs to 
understand 'I have to work' as meaning 'I am not coming'.  
 
There are sentence fragments. For example, answers to questions might be"
"single words or phrases, and grammatically they might be almost anything 
(nouns, adjectives, verbs, noun phrases etc.) From a logical point of view, 
we would expect a linguistic component to be either a reference to an item"
"or be a true or false statement about items referred to. But extracting what 
is what from a fragment might require looking back through to dialog to 
earlier questions or context. (Bobrow et al. 1977)  have the example : 
 
Computer: In what name should I make the reservation, please?"
"Client: Dan Bobrow  
 
Now the 'Dan Bobrow' is a reference to a person, and not a sentence or 
statement, but what is happening here is that the assertion 'You should"
"54 make the reservation in the name of Dan Bobrow' is being made, but to 
determine that the question and earlier context are needed.  
 
In sum, dialogs are not easy to process.  
 
2.3 ELIZA to ALICE  
 
ELIZA was introduced by Joseph Weizenbaum in the paper ELIZA —a"
"computer program for the study of natural language communication 
between man and machine  (Weizenbaum 1966) . ELIZA is the first chatbot. 
It is an early, indeed very early, AI program. However, it is not a ML 
program. As we will see shortly, it works by rules and pattern substitution."
"We have an historical interest in ELIZA.  Also, its way of manipulating 
strings, playing with form not meaning, is something of style common in 
modern machine learned natural language processing. Here is a transcript 
of a typical conversation with ELIZA : 
 
Men are all alike.  
IN WHAT WAY"
"They're always bugging us about something or other.  
CAN Y OU THINK OF A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE  
Well, my boyfriend made me come here.  
YOUR BOYFRIEND MA DE YOU COME HERE  
He says I'm depressed much of the time.  
I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU ARE DEPRESSED

"DO YOU THINK COMING HERE WILL HELP YOU NOT TO BE 
UNHAPPY  
 
<and so on. The human correspondent's utterances are shown in 
lower -case, ELIZA's replies in upper -case. This extract is from  
(Weizenbaum 1966) . >"
"55  
As Weizenbaum tells us, the conversation style here intended to be between 
a patient and a Rogerian psychotherapist. There is an important sleight of 
hand in this. A Rogerian psychotherapist feeds, or replies, back some"
"variation of what the patient has said. The psychotherapist does not say 
anything that requires knowledge of the world. This matters because ELIZA 
does not then need any knowledge. So, this might be a conversational 
fragment : 
 
I went for a long boat ride  
TELL ME ABOUT BOATS"
"But a request for knowledge would meet with avoidance, perhaps : 
 
What is a boat?  
HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN BOATS?  
 
The basic computational procedure for ELIZA is simple. The input text is 
inspected for one or more matches to patterns. A pattern here usually"
"amounts to a string, where some parts are literals and other parts are 
variables. So, for example, if we use (?X), (?Y), etc. as variables, then  
 
I feel (?X)  
 
is a pattern (the 'I feel ' part is a literal, and the '(?X)' is a variable). The"
"matching process takes some input text and a pattern, or patterns, and sees 
whether they can be matched. For example :"
"56 'I feel (?X)' can be matched with 'I feel sad' (or, indeed, 'I feel sick', 'I 
feel happy', 'I feel cold' etc. ) but not matched with 'I read novels'  
 
Then there are rules which dictate how the matched results are to be 
transformed. For example :"
"Rule #3: 'I feel (?X)' is to be transformed to 'DO YOU OFTEN 
FEEL (?X)' where, of course, the value for (?X) is substituted back 
in. 
 
Usually, several different patterns will match the input text. Then each of 
those patterns might have several different transformation rules that apply."
"What happens here is that there is a randomizer which makes a choice of 
what to use. The reason for this randomization is that it allows ELIZA to 
produce different responses to the same input text. So, each conversation,"
"or session, will usually be slightly different to earlier ones. At this point, 
ELIZA can be improved by adding some memory of the conversation or 
correspondent, being more sophisticated with the responses, and so forth. 
There are ELIZA like chatbots alive and well today — most notably ALICE"
"(Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity ) (Wikipedia 2022c) .   
 
There are two important points to note about ELIZA systems. What they do 
is trivial substitution of one piece of text for another. Merely by looking at"
"the source code and a transcript for a session you can see which patterns 
and rules were used, step by step. The inner workings are crystal clear. 
There is no mystery here, nor any intelligence. Nevertheless, a good 
proportion of folk think that ELIZA systems are intelligent, or even that,"
"when talking with ELIZA, that they are conversing with a human."
"57 Weizenbaum noted this in his original paper, and in 1972 the ELIZA system 
PARRY passed the Turing Test (i.e. fooled some people into thinking it was 
human) ( (Weizenbaum 1966; Colby et al. 1972)   
 
2.4 The Turing Test"
"Are you wondering what the Turing Test is? Here is ChatGPT's explanation 
of it (provided on 12/6/2022, while ChatGPT was available as a research 
preview):  
 
 
Figure 1. Explanation of Turing Test.  
 
2.5 Machine Learning Chit -Chat Bots"
"ML systems can learn to chit -chat. They do need data of conversations, and 
a large quantity of it. There are databases, or datasets, of conversations (e.g. 
of telephone conversations). Then dialogs from movies are a good source."
"Also, sometimes, crowdsourcing is used (people either volunteer or are paid 
to converse in an interesting and potentially useful way). Roughly speaking,"
"58 the systems can either retrieve or generate. Retrieval systems will look 
through the conversations that they are aware of and select fragments 
similar to the one they are addressing, make a choice or ranking among the 
fragments, then return a suitable response. Generative systems can"
"'generate' a response. They learn from their training (and subsequent 
conversations) what might be suitable in which circumstances. In a sense, 
they are learning rules. But there are not a fixed number of rules 
programmed in before the system starts learning. The responses that"
"generative systems produce can be novel or new.  
 
2.6 LaMDA  
 
LaMDA, from Google, is a family of Language Models for Dialog 
Applications (Thoppilan et al. 2022) . These models are for Chit -chat bots. 
We will briefly describe here what they were designed for and what they can"
"do, and in Chapter 3 we will go into a little more technical detail.  
 
LaMDA agents should be able to supply conversational quality in dialogs 
lasting 20 turns or more. What they say should be safe. It should be safe, 
period. Some earlier non -LaMDA dialog agents have suggested that their"
"conversational partners eat ground glass as a treatment for a medical 
condition. This is not a good or desirable outcome. Additionally, the dialog 
agent should not offer any views that are biased or toxic. Finally, the 
conversational contribution needs to be grounded. One might take"
"grounded t o mean that the views expressed be true and supported by 
evidence. But that condition is too strong in as much as there are many 
areas where there are competing rival views and where all the views have"
"59 some reasonableness to them. Grounded is just the requirement that if the 
agent professes opinions offered as factual then those opinions need not to 
be fictional or  hallucinatory. (Historically, conversational agents have been"
"known occasionally to offer plausible assertions which are pure fantasy.)  
 
2.7 ChatGPT  
 
ChatGPT was produced by OpenAI. ChatGPT itself tells us about OpenAI : 
 
OpenAI is a research institute that was founded in 2015 by a group"
"of entrepreneurs, researchers, and investors who were interested 
in advancing the field of artificial intelligence . The organization 
was created with the goal of promoting and developing friendly 
AI, which is AI that is aligned with human values and capable of"
"working towards the benefit of humanity. Since its founding, 
OpenAI has become one of the leading organizations in the field of 
AI research,  and has made significant contributions to the 
development of ML algorithms and technologies. Some of the"
"notable achievements of OpenAI include the development of the 
GPT -3 language model, which is one of the most advanced natural 
language processing systems in the world, and the creation of the 
DALL -E artificial intelligence system, which is capable of"
"generating images from text descriptions. Overall, OpenAI has 
played a major role in advancing the field of AI and in fostering 
the development of safe and beneficial AI technologies  (ChatGPT 
output to the question 'What is the history of OpenAI?' 
12/15/2022) ."
"ChatGPT  is a Large Language Model (LLM), or a Foundation Model. Quite 
what those features are will be explained in the next chapter s. The LLM 
chatbots are so much in advance of all the other earlier chatbots that the"
"earlier ones are  mostly render ed obsolete and of historical interest only. As 
of November 2022, ChatGPT was a chat front end to GPT -3.5 (OpenAI"
"60 2022a) . GPT -3.5 itself is a Generative, Pre -trained, Transformer, iteration 
3.5. 'Generative' here means that it can predict, or generate, new output. 
'Pre-trained' means that it has a two -stage training. First a pre -training,"
"and then a specific shaping to the final product. Finally, 'Transformer' is the 
type of machine learning system. GPT -3.5 was current as of December 
2022 . GPT -4.0 was released in March 2023  (and likely  new versions will be 
arriving )."
"Progress, or change, in th e research area of  LLM chatbots , is extremely 
rapid . Anything written here right now will be out of date in days or weeks. 
Please be aware of that. We know what LLMs  are, how they are produced,"
"and how they work, to a degree. That can be described. There is another 
caution besides the changing landscape. The large language models are so 
complex that there is no real description, explanation, or analysis of the"
"details of their internal workings. Likely this will not change anytime soon.  
 
ChatGPT (using GPT 3.5) can: 
 
• Write high  school to college level essays, to about an A standard. The 
written English is definitely of A standard, and usually the factual"
"content (if that is required or appropriate) is also of A quality. This 
means that it can write essays for students, articles for journalists, 
and sometimes, or almost, write research papers for researchers.  
• Tell jokes, write poetry, and produce cooking recipes."
"• Write, or correct computer programs. This also is carried out to a high 
standard. This makes it a valuable programming, or debugging, tool. 
(OpenAI and Github had earlier developed Copilot, which is a"
"61 programmer's assistant (Github 2022) . Copilot's abilities seem to be 
built in to ChatGPT).  
 
As part of chatting ChatGPT can : 
 
… answer follow -up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge 
incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests  (OpenAI 
2022a) ."
"It does have some weaknesses (which we will look at further in the next 
Chapter). But briefly : 
 
• It is not good on basic mathematics and arithmetic . 
• Its knowledge is not current. (Its training data is from pre -2020. This"
"means that it has no knowledge, for example, of recent politics or 
sporting events.)  
• Sometimes it can go completely wrong. For example, some User s 
have reported of occasions when ChatGPT has referred to books that 
do not exist."
"The weaknesses that it has have been fully acknowledged by OpenAI (and 
many of them will be addressed in short order).  
 
Nevertheless, just what it can do is astonishing. It can produce, or generate, 
grammatical correct and sophisticated English that in most cases could not"
"be distinguished from that written by an educated native speaker. It also 
has, or appears to have, extensive factual knowledge. There is an example"
"62 above (Section 2.4 on the Turing Test). There are a plethora of examples of 
ChatGPT output available online. (There were one million registered Users 
within a couple of days of its research release on 11/30/2022, and almost all"
"of those published their experiences on social media, discussion sites (like 
Reddit), or in online journals or newspapers.) This research release does 
not reveal everything about its capabilities. For example, it seems to have a"
"problem with truth. It writes plausible English  but seems to do that without 
knowing whether what it is saying is true or has evidence in its favor. 
Contrast this with the Google Search engine. If you asked that about the 
Turing test, it would return a ranked list of links. ChatGPT seems much"
"better here, just from a User interface point of view. But if you wanted to re -
assure yourself, when using Google Search, you could follow some or all of 
the links and get a sense of the foundations or grounding of what the"
"contents of the links were asserting. With ChatGPT, truth, fiction, and well -
formed writing, seem all to run into one. On tricky topics, or more 
complicated concepts, ChatGPT sometimes gave highly plausible answers 
that are flat -out wrong — something its creators warn about in their"
"disclaimers. It may be, so -to-speak, that ChatGPT knows why it says what it 
does, but we are not fully aware of that at this point.  It has been said 
'fiction  is what ChatGPT is really good at '.  
 
2.8 Task -Oriented"
"Most task -oriented dialog agents (including Siri, Cortan a, Alexa, and OK 
Google) use Genial Understander System (GUS) architecture (Bobrow et al. 
1977; Daniel Jurafsky and Martin 2021) ."
"63  
GUS (Genial Understander System) is intended to engage a 
sympathetic and highly cooperative human in an English dialog, 
directed towards a specific goal within a very restricted domain of 
discourse ….  
There is good reason for restricting the domain of discourse for a"
"computer system which is to engage in an English dialog. 
Specializing the subject matter that the system can talk about 
permi ts it to achieve some measure of realism without 
encompassing all the possibilities of human knowledge or of the"
"English language. It also provides the user with specific 
motivation for participating in the conversation, thus narrowing 
the range of expectations that GUS must have about the user's 
purposes. A system restricted in this way will be more able to"
"guide the conversation within the boundaries of its competence.  
(Bobrow et al. 1977)   
 
This GUS architecture is not itself a ML architecture, rather it is an older AI 
frame -and-slot design. The implementations do use natural language,"
"English, say, and so the modern dialog agents will use recent NLP machine 
learned techniques.  
 
A frame is a mini -world, or situation, or ontology, that captures everything 
that either is known or needs to be known about a certain set up. For"
"example, consider on online take -out system for a restaurant. There will 
need to be a menu (with appetizers, entrées, deserts, etc.), a recipient's 
name address, payment details, and so forth. These constitute the frame (or 
perhaps even several frames), and the frame has slots (one for the"
"appetizers, one for the credit card number, …). The slots will have types.  
For example, the purchaser's name is a string (e.g. 'John Smith') and the 
credit card number is a number (e.g. 1234 5678 9100 1234). What GUS will"
aim to do is to be genial while filling all the requisite slots with values of the
"64 required type. In principle, it really is not a lot more difficult than form 
filling. After all, you can order take -out from a form on a web page. Adding 
a voice interface makes the process harder.  
 
Different computer programmers may well organize the algorithms for a"
"GUS architecture in different ways. We can sketch here the general 
approach of the 1977 original. The program will try to retain the dialog 
initiative as much as possible. There will be an agenda loop of events or 
tasks to be done. This pattern is standard event -loop (or real time)"
"processing. The program will keep going around the loop until it meets an 
exit condition. Tasks can be added to, or removed from, the agenda. Tasks 
can be susp ended, to be revisited later. There will be an overall frame with"
"slots, and possible many subsidiary frames with their slots. The event -loop 
of tasks will aim to fill all the slots that need filling. (Some slots may be able 
to be left open in certain circumstances.) Many of the slots will have their"
"own sub -programs, which will be invoked when the slot is filled. (For 
example, two slots might need the same value (e.g. a departure city in a 
reservation system). Then each of these slots might have small prog ram to"
"put a value for the departure city into the other slot, if required, when its 
own value is filled.) Verbal or textual input will be able to be taken at any 
time (and added to the processing loop). Output (i.e. responses) will be"
"given at the program's direction. The actual processing of the dialog will be 
where the real difficulties lie. There will be morphological processing (to 
pick up the words), syntactical processing (to pick up the sentences), and a"
"good amount more to make sense of the vagarie s of dialog and to fit the 
results into the overall state of the system. Also, the filling of the slots will"
"65 itself often require interfacing with one or more databases (for example, to 
look up the departure times of the trains or airplanes) . 
 
2.9 GPTs  
 
On 11/6/2023,  OpenAI announced their initiative that provides an 
infrastructure for users to create  and use what they call  ‘GPTs ’ (Altman"
"2023; OpenAI 2023d) . These are customized variants of ChatGPT which 
can follow instructions in a natural language, access documents outside of 
their training (such as pdfs and research papers) , and use third party 
services (such as search engines)."
"GPTs are extremely easy to create. The process being carried out in natural 
language. Here is one produced in less than 5 minutes :"
"66  
 
Figure 2. The Scholarly Search Assistant, an Example of a GPT ."
"67  
 
 
 
Figure 3. The Configuration of the ‘Scholarly Search Assistant’ ."
"68  
At this point,  with GPTs,  the production of many chatbots is nearly trivial. 
Quite how they work is another question. By the end of Chapter 5 on Large 
Multimodal Models, we should have some reasonable insights on that."
"GPT -4 Turbo , released November 2023,  has processing images and voice 
synthesis built in (i.e. it is multimodal). The GPTs are going to use GPT -4 
Turbo as their computing engine. Shortly the chatting will be able to be by 
text or by audio.

"70 Chapter 3: Language Models  
 
3.1 Introduction  
 
Many of the modern AI systems have their origins with language models. 
These typically use text as input and produce text as output. Language 
models have a huge advantage, when considered as a ML research"
"challenge. They can be trained on (unlabeled) text, and there is plenty of 
that (for example, the Internet). Elsewhere, any ML program, trained by 
supervised learning, will need a quantity of high -quality  labeled data, and"
"that is hard to come by. But most language models will be able to be trained 
by self -supervision using digitized text.  
 
Emily Bender and her co -authors explain language models as :  
 
… the term language model (LM) … [refer s] to systems which are"
"trained on string prediction tasks: that is, predicting the likelihood 
of a token (character, word or string) given either its preceding 
context or (in bidirectional and masked LMs) its surrounding 
context. Such systems are unsupervised and when deployed, take"
"a text as input, commonly outputting scores or string predictions. 
(Bender et al. 2021)  
 
What does this mean? Some background theory will be useful here."
"71 3.2 Markov Chains  
 
Alexander Pushkin , the eminent Russian poet, playwright , and novelist, 
writes : 
 
   My uncle’s goodness is extreme,  
   If seriously he hath disease;  
   He hath acquired the world’s esteem  
   And nothing more important sees;  
   A paragon of virtue he!"
"But what a nuisance it will be,  
   Chained to his bedside night and day  
   Without a chance to slip away.  
   Ye need dissimulation base  
   A dying man with art to soothe,  
   Beneath his head the pillow smooth,  
   And physic bring with mournful face,  
   To sigh and meditate alone:"
"When will the devil take his own!  (Pushkin 1881)  
 
This is from an English translation of Eugene Onegin: A Romance of 
Russian Life in Verse  written in Russian.  
 
There is an interesting tidbit of information associated with this. Until"
"about 1900, probabilistic analyses of common sequences of apparently 
random events assumed that the individual events were independent one 
from another. So, as examples, that the second and subsequent throws of a 
single gambling die are not influenced in any way by the earlier throws, and"
"that the outcome of a spin of a roulette wheel does not depend on the spin, 
or spins, that went before. The Russian mathematician Andrei Andreevich 
Markov questioned whether this independence assumption held of all"
"72 sequences, especially in fields outside of gambling. He conjectured that it 
did not and produced a suitable mathematical theory to cover the case.  
 
The basic theory is relatively easy to understand. Almost everybody is 
familiar with the centuries old board game Snakes and Ladders. In this,"
"there is a board with a hundred and one numbered squares on it, and 
players advance from the start (i.e. 0) to 100 by repeatedly throwing dice 
and using the numbers they obtain. The first player to 100 wins. On the 
board there are some 'snakes' and some 'ladders'. These connect pairs of"
"numbers, usually separated by 5 to 20 intervening numbers. The heads of 
the indiv idual snakes are higher — of a higher number — than the tails. If a 
player lands on the head of a snake, they have to go backwards to the tails,"
"losing some of their advance. If a player lands on the base of a ladder, they 
advance to the top of that ladder. Consider just one player, and one die, and 
assume the player throws a 5. This may advance the player 5 spaces, but it"
"also may send the player back some spaces or it may send the player 
forward more spaces than 5. What happens depends in part on what squar e 
the player is on. Throwing a 5 when on square 15 might produce an entirely 
different result, in terms of going forward or backward, than throwing a 5"
"when on square 32. The square that the player is on is the state . The throw 
of the single die will produce one of six numbers. This will move the player 
to one of six other states. The values of the throws (in this case) are equally"
"probable, and so there are six equally probable non -zero transition 
probabilities  from the current state to the next state. Wha t happens with a 
throw depends only on the current state (and the value of the throw). It"
"does not depend on the state before the current state, or any before that, i.e. 
on the history of the individual game. For example, if a player is on square"
"73 27, state 27, that is all that matters — it does not matter how the player got 
to 27. Snakes and Ladders play is an example of a Markov Chain. 
Conceptually, there is usually time, or a time step, or time beats, involved in"
"producing the sequence of states in a Markov Chain. If we wanted to build 
that into the example, we could just require that the player throws the die 
every 30 seconds. There are a few other details that can be added to the 
Snakes and Ladders example to make it closer to Markov Chain theory."
"There is usually a start state, or a probability among the states for one being 
the start state. So, the zero square would have a probability of 1 of being the 
start state (and the other states 1 -100 probability zero). Similarly, there"
"might be a terminal state. If so, there would be no transition probabilities 
for a move out of the 100 square. Also, it is not possible to rest on the foot 
of a ladder or the head of a snake (because the player would be required to"
"move on elsewhere). This could be represented either by having no 
transition probabilities that end with the foot of a ladder, or the head of a 
snake, and including the jumps in with the dice values, or just by omitting 
those 'states' altogether. Summing up Markov Chains, there is a sequence of"
"events, states, transition probabilities, and the dependence on the state is 
just with the current state. This latter is the key feature of Markov Chains, 
the dependency is with a single state only, the current state, and not with 
earlier states. (Sometimes this is called the Markov Property.)"
"What did Markov do with Eugene Onegin ? He divided the first 20,000 
characters of the text into consonants and vowels (in Russian, of course). 
This gave him a value for the overall probability  of a particular character 
being a consonant (or being a vowel). He then looked at pairs of"
consecutive characters and what the probabilities were for the second
"74 character being a consonant (or a vowel) if the first character was a 
vowel (or a consonant) . These are transition probabilities from vowels to 
consonants, and consonants to vowels. What he found was that vowels were 
more likely to be followed by consonants (and consonants by vowels) — that"
"the transition probabilities were different to the overall probabilities. What 
this meant was that if the text was thought of as a sequence or stream of 
letters, the appearance of one letter after another was not an independent"
"event, being governed by only the overall probabilities of the letters, rather 
it was a dependent event having a dependence on the current letter or state. 
From here, there is the theory and mathematics of Markov Chains."
"Markov Chains are everywhere. They are in text. Not just with consonants 
and vowels, but also with letter sequences like 'u' following 'q', and word 
sequences like the word 'He' being followed by a verb phrase. They are in"
"spoken text, or speech, with sequences of phonemes (certain sounds follow 
others). They are in the weather (rainy days tend to follow other rainy 
days). Many games — the sequences of their moves — can be analyzed by 
Markov Chains (e.g. chess). The Stock Market can be seen as a Markov"
"Chain (bull markets tend to be followed by bull markets, and bear markets 
followed by bear markets). There are many Markov Chains in biology, for 
example with DNA sequences. More -0r-less any values or measurements 
that change over time, such as prices in a stock market, speeds of motor"
"cars, etc., can be modeled by Markov Chains. [There is a paper Five 
greatest applications of Markov Chains  (Von Hilgers and Langville 2006) . 
It is recommended.]"
"75 3.3 Hidden Markov Models  
 
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are extremely common in the ML analysis 
of sequential data that has a dependence on time. Typically, a model will be 
able to explain a sequence and predict or generate new sequences. The"
"techniques are most at home with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and 
with handwriting recognition, speech recognition, and biological 
informatics.  
 
With an HMM there are two collections of probabilities. In the background,"
"there is a probabilistic Markov Chain or Process as explained above. But 
some, or all, of the states of this Markov Process are hidden (and unseeable 
directly by observers). However, the hidden states 'emit' observations 
which can be seen or observed. These emissions of observations are"
"themselves governed by probabilities relating them to the hidden states. An 
example might help with understanding the set -up. Suppose we are 
interest ed in the sequences of year -on-year climate values in New Zealand 
from a thousand years ago. (We may be  interested in this because the"
"climate affects the environment, its flora and fauna, and their history and 
development.) Suppose the years can be just hot or cold, and which they are 
for a particular year depends solely on whether the predecessor year is hot"
"(or is cold). Suppose also that the probabilities of a hot year being followed 
by another hot year (and a cold year being followed by a cold year) ar e all 
known from modern values (which are assumed to be unchanged from 
those of a thousand years ago).  These ancient weather sequences are"
"Markov Processes, and their states are hidden and not directly observable. 
However, the weather affects tree -ring growth, and we have modern"
"76 probabilities relating that growth to the weather (which, again, are assumed 
to be unchanged from a thousand years ago). More than a few New Zealand 
Kauri trees live longer than a thousand years. So, the Kauri rings can serve"
"as modern emitted observations on the Hidden Markov Process of ancient 
weather sequences in New Zealand (Stamp 2017; Rabiner 1989) .  
 
We will not address the mathematics in detail here. But what the 
mathematics can do is i) estimate the probabilities for a hidden sequence,"
"give the observable sequence, and the other relevant probabilities ii) 
estimate the probabilities for an observable sequence, given the hidden 
sequence, and the other relevant probabilities, iii) given an observable 
sequence, the number of hidden model states and different types of"
"observations, can use successive approximation  on the parameters to 
produce values which give the greatest probability of yielding the provided 
sequence. ( The successive approximation uses what is known as ' gradient"
"descent ', see the excellent videos from Josh Starmer or Grant Sanders on for 
explanations of gradient descent (Starmer and StatQuest 2019; Sanderson 
and 3Blue1Brown 2017b) . Gradient descent is a standard ML technique. ) 
 
As mentioned, Natural Language Processing often uses HMMs. Mark"
"Stamp, in his (Stamp 2017) , gives a simple example of language analysis, 
which is more -or-less the inverse of Markov's Eugene Onegin  case. Say you 
gave 'Marvin the Martian' (an alien) a corpus of a million words of actual"
"English text and invited him/her/them to investigate sets of individual 
characters under the assumption that there was a HMM, with two hidden 
states, that was producing the observed English. The result of Marvin's 
research would be that there were two relevant sets of letters, and they"
"77 would be the vowels and the consonants. Initially, Marvin knows nothing 
about English, yet Marvin can learn structural and statistical properties 
using an HMM.  
 
Marvin, and Markov, in the Onegin  example, are looking at individual"
"characters or letters. But what is much more useful and widespread in the 
general NLP case is analyzing entire words, or parts of words, and, for 
example, tagging them with their parts of speech (POS). In this, HMMs are 
often used to identify nouns, verbs, adjectives, determiners, etc. Parts of"
"speech point to the function of the words in the sentences i.e. they hint at 
role or meaning.  
 
3.4 Shannon's Guessing Game  
3.4.1 Introduction  
An interesting precursor of modern NLP research is the 1940s work of 
Claude Shannon on signal information (C E Shannon 1948) . Shannon"
"provided an extensive analysis of  the natural language  English and it is 
worthwhile to follow and develop his reasoning.  He was trying to calculate 
how much entropy (signal information) there was in passages of English. 
(What entropy and signal information are need not concern us.) The"
"approach here was to use successive approximation by models . Shannon’s 
zero -order model  assumed that the alphabetic letters or characters had an 
equal probability of occurring in English text. But i n real English, assuming"
"here that the speaker  or writer  is not idiosyncratic, the occurrence of letters 
is not equiprobable; 'e', for example, has a probability of 0.13 of occurring 
and 'w' a probability of 0.02. If the differing probabilities for all the letters"
"78 are taken into account , that produces what is known as the first -order 
model . There are also conditional , or transition,  probabilities relating 
letters in letter sequences in English; 'q', for example, is almost invariably"
"followed by 'u'. This model is now using a Markov process for analysis. Two 
letter sequences, giving  the second -order model, can be considered, or 
three letter sequences and so on. A similar approach can be adopt ed to 
predicting a missing word or the next word,  using whole words as the"
"alphabet and not just single letters.  (Filling in the blanks in some text is 
known as a 'cloze task'. These will be explained in more detail shortly).  
 
The assumption of non -idiosyncrasy  of the source English text  is entirely in"
"order — John Pierce tells us of E.V. Wright  who published the 267 page 
novel Gadsby  in which there are no 'e's (Pierce 1980)  p.48 ). There is an 
important point to be made here. When there is focus on the probabilities"
"of occurrences of letters in text, say 'e's, there is a need to address context. 
Such probabilities may well have different values depending on, for 
example, whether the text is Gadsby , the Sunday Times , or every piece of"
"English on the Internet. Care is also needed here with the relation between 
the training data and the intended real use data (the test data) for ML 
language probabilities. You would not want to use Gadsby as the sole 
training data for all of written English."
"Shannon  conducted extensive experiments on English. One technique he 
used was to give test subjects many letters of a sequence of English —usually 
up to about 50 letters —and then ask them to guess the next unknown letter"
"(a cloze task) ; he found that the subjects were able to guess correctly about 
half the time or more . (You can try Shannon’s experiment  or game :- pick"
"79 roughly the middle letter of any line in this book, count forward fifty letters, 
keeping the fifty first  letter  covered  before making your guess , and see how 
uncertain you are about the value of the fifty first letter.)"
"The results show that English is massively redundant.  This redundancy has 
its advantages. Natural languages are highly noise tolerant — often many 
letters in a message can go missing or be mis -transcribed and yet still the"
"receiver will be able reconstruct the original. (And also, yet again as 
Shannon pointed out, without redundancy, crossword puzzles would be 
impossible.)  
 
English is usually taken to be an ergodic source  (roughly, that means that"
"one reasonable passage is a good representative of the whole, as far as all 
the probabilities are concerned). However, so -called Large Language 
Models and Foundation Models would typically use vast amounts of text as 
input data (see, for example, Common Crawl (Common Crawl 2022) )."
"There is a good reason for that. As we will see these models are trying to do 
more than evaluate probabilities; they are,  for example, also trying to 
acquire knowledge (such as, the fact that George Orwell is the author of the 
book 1984 )."
"3.4.2 Shannon's Approximations as Markov  Processes  
 
[An indicative fact: Shannon's seminal 1948 paper originally had the title A 
Mathematical Theory of Communication . In 1949 , when reprinted in"
"80 (Claude Elwood Shannon and Weaver 1949) , it was renamed  The 
Mathematical Theory of Communication . Enough said. ]

probabilities are correct but no further structure is included.  
THE HEAD AND IN FRONTAL ATTACK ON AN ENGLISH 
WRITER THAT THE CHARACTER OF THIS POINT IS"
"81 THEREFORE ANOTHER METHOD FOR THE LETTERS THAT 
THE TIME OF WHO EVER TOLD THE PROBLEM FOR AN 
UNEXPECTED.  
The resemblance to ordinary English text increases quite 
noticeably at each of the above steps. Note that these samples"
"have reasonably good structure out to about twice the range that is 
taken into account in their construction. Thus in (3) the statistical 
process insures reasonable text for two -letter sequences, but four - 
letter sequences from the sample can usually be fitted into good"
"sentences. In (6) sequences of four or more words can easily be 
placed in sentences without unusual or strained constructions. (C 
E Shannon 1948, 7)  
 
Shannon starts here with equiprobable letters, the zero -order 
approximation, then moves to allow the letters to have the probabilities"
"that they do in real English. Then, with the second -order approximation, he 
allows the letters to have transition probabilities — probabilities dependent 
on the single preceding letter only. So, if the preceding letter were 'Q', for"
"example, the probability of the next letter being 'Z' would be zero, the 
probability of it being 'U' would be high , the probability of the next letter 
being a blank space would have some positive value, and so on. At this 
point what is going on is a Markov process. Shannon tells us this:"
"Stochastic processes of the type described above are known 
mathematically as discrete Markoff processes and have been 
extensively studied in the literature. (C E Shannon 1948, 8)  
 
The preceding letter  in the second -order approximation  is a state  or context"
"and the relevant probability depends on that state.  The third -order 
approximation uses transition probabilities,  but this time extends the state 
or context to the two preceding letters. At this point, Shannon switches to"
"using entire words, not individual letters, and that is not of further interest 
to us here. A point to note is that 1948, Shannon would have had no way of"
"82 calculating transition probabilities using three, four, five, …, and so on 
preceding letters.  (Basically, you need computers and digitized text to do 
that.) Had he been able to do so, no doubt he would have explored much 
larger contexts."
"3.4.3 Training a Shannon -Markov  Model to Produce 'A Baby 
GPT'  
 
Nowadays, we can train a Shannon -Markov model to evaluate the 
transition probabilities for itself , using self -supervised learning . The result 
is what is in effect a GPT  (a Generative Pre -Trained Transformer) . Andrej"
"Karpathy suggested th e following  as an example  (Karpathy 2023a) . There 
are s ome serious simplifications in this. 
 
The alphabet consists of  two tokens  {A,B} 
 
The context  (or prompt)  is the three preceding letters. So, there"
"are eight states (namely AAA , AAB , ABA , ABB , etc.)  There will be 
16 transition probabilities from the contexts to the next token, 
namely  
 
AAA ->A with probability unknown  
AAA ->B with probability unknown  
AAB ->A with probability unknown  
AAB ->A with probability unknown  
Etc."
"Etc.  
 
These  probabilities  need to be determined  from the training data , 
by training . [We can note, though, each context can produce either 
A or B and if the probability for one of those is x the probability"
"83 for the other is (1 -x). So , there are eight values to be  pinned 
down .] 
 
The training data , the training text,  is the sequence of 15 tokens : 
 
 AAAABAAAABAAAAB  
 
What our ML system is going to do is to produce a 'next token' as"
"an output, then do that again, and again, …, to give 15 tokens . It 
needs a 3 token context to start with. So, we will give it three As as 
its initialization  or prompt  
 
AAA  
 
then let it run to produce the next 12 tokens . Just to explain"
"further. The first prompt will produce an output token, say B.  
 
AAA B 
 
Then, the new token gets included in the next prompt and  first  
token in the earlier prompt gets dropped out of the prompt, and,  
A, say, is generated.  
 
AAABA"
"AAABA 
 
So there is a continuous 'adding, and dropping, and sliding 
forward'.  The ML system sees only three symbols at a time, the 
ones shown in green, but those three symbols change through 
time.  
 
Suppose, for the first training round, it completes its generation  
and produces"
"AAABBAABABAABAB  
 
This output will be compared with the training data. There will be 
a scoring system that evaluates it. Then the machine learning 
model will revise its internal weights  (i.e. parameters) . It will"
"84 improve itself.  And there will be a second training round,  and a 
third,  and the process will be repeated over and over.  Karpathy 
has provided sample software to do this, and typically there might 
be 50 rounds of training. In his publication, the  training"
"determine d the transition probabilities to be  
 
AAA ->A with probability o.45  
AAA ->B with probability 0.55  
AAB ->A with probability 0.78  
AAB ->A with probability 0.22  
Etc.  
 
Looking from outside the system we can see  what the transition"
"probabilities should be. The context is the three previous tokens. 
We can slide the context window through the training text seeing 
what the outcome tokens are.  
 
AAA ABAAAABAAAAB *  
AAAA BAAAABAAAAB *  
AAAAB AAAABAAAAB  
AAAABAAAABAAAAB  ! 
AAAABAAAABAAAAB  
AAAAB AAA ABAAAAB *"
"AAAABA AAA BAAAAB *  
AAAABAA AAB AAAAB  
AAAABAAA ABA AAAB  ! 
AAAABAAAA BAA AAB 
AAAABAAAAB AAA AB * 
AAAABAAAABA AAA B * 
 
To take two example s from this, the context AAA appears 6 times (an 
asteri sk picks them). Three of these are followed by A, and three followed"
"by B. So, roughly speaking, we might expect that both :  
 
AAA ->A  
AAA ->B"
"85 would  have a probability of near 0.5 (in fact , the published training run 
gave 0.45  for one and 0.55  for the other). For the second example, the 
context ABA appears twice , identified by an exclamation mark,  and each"
"time it is followed by an A. So, ABA ->A should be 1.0 and ABA ->B should 
be 0.0 (the published training run gave 0.78  and 0.22 ). There were only 50 
rounds of training. If more rounds were used, the values would sharpen to 
the correct values."
"Notice that some of the possible contexts do not appear in the training data. 
For example, BBB does not. So, what should happen with a BBB  context is 
an open question . It is not determined by the training data. It is at this"
"point that  what is called  inductive bias  enters. The system needs to make a 
'reasonable' guess and with the Karpathy sample implementation it goes 
with 0.5 chance of getting an A, and 0.5 of getting a B , for all contexts it 
cannot determine from the data."
"At this point, we have a 'baby GPT'. It is a Shannon/Markov model with a 
context of 3 preceding tokens.  It can generate output. Here is one example 
that it produced :  
 
AAABAAABAAABAABAAAABABA  
 
To compare the baby with a GPT like GPT -3. Our alphabet has 2 tokens, a"
"full-blown GPT would likely use 'words' and not individual letters in its 
alphabet and it might have an alphabet of 50,000 different tokens (words). 
Our context is a context of the 3 previous tokens, a full -blown GPT might"
"use a context  window that can see  the 30,000  previous tokens. As of May 
2023, Anthropic's Claude model has a context window of 100,000 tokens"
"86 (which is about 70,000 words — its tokens are larger than single characters, 
but smaller than entire words). Our training text is 15 tokens long. GPT -4's 
training text is more -or-less 'the entire Internet'. We can train in"
"milliseconds. GPT -4 takes months on parallel 'supercomputers'. The baby 
was trained on 50 rounds ('epochs') of training. OpenAI has not disclosed 
how many epochs of training it used (we asked GPT -4 this question) but it 
will have been in thousands.   
 
3.5 Taylor's Cloze Procedure"
"In 1953, Wilson L. Taylor published the paper ""Cloze Procedure"": A New 
Tool For Measuring Readability  (W. L. Taylor 1953) . Basically, cloze 
procedures amount to taking some text and deleting parts of it, then 
inviting the human subjects (or software) to fill in the blanks to recreate the"
"original text. Taylor writes : 
 
Given ""Chickens cackle and  --- quack,"" almost anyone can 
instantly supply ""ducks."" ….. 
Note that the sentence pattern is a complex one made up of 
many sub -patterns. One must know not only the meanings"
"(i.e., patterns of symbol -meaning relationships) and forms 
(patterns of letters) of all the five words, but also the 
meanings of given combinations of them — plus the fact that 
the sentence structure seems to demand a term parallel to 
""cackle"" but associated with ducks instead of chickens. In"
"other words, one must guess what the mutilated sentence 
means as a whole, then complete its pattern to fit that whole 
meaning.  (W. L. Taylor 1953)  
 
As the title of his paper indicates, Taylor's original idea was to use cloze"
procedures as one tool to assess the reading skills of subjects. But
"87 subsequently their use has expanded far beyond this. Cloze tasks, or cloze  
procedures are reasonably demanding and they are a popular research 
technique for modern Natural Language Processing (NLP). [Nowadays, it is 
a common practice for researchers to write '[Mask]' to show where the"
"blanks are. So , Taylor's illustrative sentence would be written : 
 
Given ""Chickens cackle and  [Mask]  quack,"" almost anyone can 
instantly supply ""ducks.""  
] 
 
3.6 nanoGPT and an Illustration of Training  
 
Andrej Karpathy has provided for us nanoGPT (Karpathy [2022] 2023) ."
"This  is some software you can run at home (do try it!). It is : 
 
The simplest, fastest repository for training/finetuning medium -
sized GPTs. [It can reproduce]  GPT -2 (Karpathy [2022] 2023)  
 
nanoGPT  is a language model, and it can be used to illustrate training."
"Aatish Bhatia has done exactly that  in the implementation he calls 
BabyGPT  (Bhatia 2023) . One of the examples that Bhatia provides concerns 
Jane Austen. To paraphrase Bhatia, BabyGPT is provided with the 800,000 
words of Jane Austen's work and also a prompt :"
"""You must decide for yourself"", said Elizabeth  [We assume here 
that this prompt is not among the actual work of Austen , 
otherwise that would ruin the training, inviting what is called 
overfitting  (here this means that it has been told an answer in its 
training) .]"
"88 And what BabyGPT has to do , its task,  is to produce the next seventy or so 
words written in the style of Jane Austen. The process will be for it to 
output about 700 characters , one at a time . It will produce one character."
"Then having done that, produce the second character, and so on, until it 
reaches about 700 characters. A blank space is a character (as are 
punctuation marks and upper -case characters). Thus, some character 
sequences will have the appearance of sequences of words (or even of"
"phrases and sentences). There will be a scoring system that evaluates the 
mistakes. Learning  will be used to change the parameters of BabyGPT. 
Then this will be done again, and again, forming round after round. In the 
first round it produced : 
 
""You must decide for yourself"", said Elizabeth"
"grThbE22]i10anZOj1A2u'T - t'wMOZeVsa.f0JC1hpndrsR

77Wq'Y4NtV:_'N  [and more]  
 
Here, it  is producing characters randomly, of equal probability. This is 
Shannon's zero -order model. Were this first round to be run again, with the"
"parameters  re-set to their original values , the output would likely be 
different.  [A character set, with special characters in it, might have a 
repertoire of 256 different characters. So, the probability for any particular"
"character appearing in any particular position is 1/256.  Getting the same 
output sequence twice is very unlikely. ] 
 
After 250 rounds  of training , it produced :"
"89 ""You must decide for yourself"", said Elizabeth gra buseriteand the 
utharth s atouchanders nd shadeto the se owrerer o thino athe 
athetlf w wad asire  [and more]  
 
This is now similar to Shannon's first -order model. It has figured out that"
"not all letters are equiprobable (for example, that special characters do not 
occur very often and that 'e's occur relatively frequently).  After 30,000 
rounds it produced : 
 
""You must decide for yourself"", said Elizabeth rather repeatedly;"
"""that is very agreeable displeasure, they will ever be a lively young 
woman as it will be more disagreeable."" ""My dear Fanny,  [and 
more]  
 
Now there are words, sentences , some grammar, and a character stream 
approximating English. This training was carried out on a laptop computer"
"in an hour. Some of the large language models, which will get to  shortly , 
might use what effectively is a super -computer for months for their 
training. Also, they may use a two -stage training. There might be a pre -"
"training, which would be a self -learning training similar  to the above. This 
then might be followed by reinforcement learning  where there is a panel of 
about forty human judges giving feedback and a scoring as to the quality of 
the output.  
 
3.7 Embeddings"
"In machine learning, an embedding is a way of representing data 
as points in n -dimensional space so that similar data points 
cluster together  (Markowitz 2022) ."
"90 A point in an n -dimensional space can be thought of as a list, or vector, of 
numbers. As examples, a  point in a 2 -dimensional space might be [2,3]; a 
point in a 3-dimensional space might be  [1,29,2]; a point in a 7 -dimensional"
"space might be [29.1, -7,2.9,13,21.6, -37.23,9]; you get the idea. Then a 
measure can be put on these lists that will show whether two or more lists 
are 'similar'. If they are, this means, or might mean, that the underlying 
data, the relevant underlying data points, are similar."
"Embeddings are important.  
 
…embeddings power:  
1. Recommendation systems (i.e. Ne tflix-style if -you-like-
these -movies -you’ll - like-this-one-too)  
2. All kinds of search  
a. Text search (like Google Search)  
b. Image search (like Google Reverse Image Search)"
"3. Chatbots and question -answering systems  
4. Data preprocessing (preparing data to be fed into a machine 
learning model)  
5. One -shot/zero -shot learning (i.e. machine learning models 
that learn from almost no training data)  
6. Fraud detection/outlier detection"
"7. Typo detection and all manners of “fuzzy matching”  
8. Detecting when ML models go stale (dri ft)  
9. So much more!  
(Markowitz 2022)  
 
We will get to most of these  applications  later.  
 
A good example of a typical use of embeddings is that provided by Cohere"
"with its embeddings of Wiki pedia articles (Reimers and Alammar 2023; 
Kayid and Reimers 2022) . What this does is to break millions of Wikipedia 
articles down into several millions of passages  of text . Then each passage is"
"91 assigned a vector (i.e. a list) of numbers. Conceptually, these vectors are 
collected together into a vector database (i.e. a library of vectors). Then, as 
a typical use, were a user to search for a topic, or a phrase, or a query, that"
"search phrase would be embedded to  produce  its own vector. Finally, the 
vector database would be searched for vectors similar to the search vector 
and the relevant actual Wikipedia passages would be retrieved and 
returned.  There is an initial embedding process to produce vector database,"
"another embedding process to embed the search phrase, then a ‘de -
embedding’ process to get the sought for Wikipedia texts back from the 
matched similar vectors.  
 
Suitable embeddings of text will embed meaning, not the surface form of"
"the words, phrases, and sentences. One consequence of this is that the 
application or software can work with multiple languages:  
 
… rely[ing]  on the property that sentences that are similar in 
meaning will have similar embeddings, even if they are in"
"different languages. (Reimers and Alammar 2023)  
 
One extremely important point about embeddings is that there is not just 
one way of producing an embedding . There are indefinitely many ways of 
doing it, usually each with their own algorithms or software. This matters"
"because the embedding algorithm  used to produce the vector database  and 
the embedding algorithm  used to embed the search phrase need to be the 
same. Care is needed here because the database will be produced at one 
point in time, say 2021, yet people might still be searching it 5 or 10  years"
"later. Typically, developers outside of the largest companies will not create 
embedding algorithms for themselves. Rather they will use algorithms from"
"92 OpenAI, Hugging Face, or other open -sourced or licensed resources. This 
exposes the developers to possibly catastrophic risk. If the algorithms, or 
their licenses or availability, are changed, the developers ’ software might be"
"irretrievably broken. To give a concrete example, later in the text we use 
OpenAI’s text-embedding -ada-002 algorithm to embed ‘Stochastic 
Psittacosis’ — were OpenAI to withdraw its provision of ada -002 that result 
basically would be come  garbage.  This matters not just to developers."
"Purchasers of software using these technologies need to be wary of 
becoming  dependent and ‘locked in’.  The risk here is real. In November 
2023, OpenAI was close to imploding as a company (with the four -day 
sacking and re -instatement of  its CEO, Sam Altman)."
"3.8 Word Embeddings and Word2Vec  
 
Word embeddings are a common and useful tool or technique to process 
words prior to their being used in ML models. Often the embeddings can 
capture useful deep syntactic and semantic information. The DL Models"
"themselves use numbers internally for their arithmetic and mathematics. 
This gives the preliminary task of converting words to numbers for use in 
the models. This coding could be done trivially by using the number 1 for 
the first word, 2 for the second word, and so on. But notice this. Say word"
"number  3 was 'toy' and word number 47 was 'toys'. Those two words are 
similar to each (one is the plural form of the other). But information of that 
similarity is lost in the coding. The numbers 3 and 47 are not similar, nor"
"do they give any hint of similarity between the words that they are coding. 
Tomas Mikolov, and fellow authors, following earlier work, proposed and 
developed the technique of using vectors  (lists of numbers)  to code the"
"93 words (Mikolov, Chen, et al. 2013; Mikolov, Sutskever, et al. 2013; Mikolov, 
Yih, and Zweig 2013; Colyer 2016; Alammar 2019) . The idea here is that in 
a large corpus of text the word 'toys', for example, appears in various"
"contexts (that is, surrounded by other words e.g. 'children', 'Xmas', and so 
forth) and it tends not to appear in other contexts (e.g. surrounded by 
words about the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl); then some aspects of"
"these appearance contexts can be placed into the vector that is to represent 
'toys'. Similarly for the word 'toy' and its contexts. The overlap of the 
contexts gives information about the words. This type of coding, 
exemplified in the software Word2Vec, can capture similarities and also"
"some real information. It can open the way to answering questions like : 
 
Paris is to France as [Mask] is to England  
 
The famous example that Word2Vec is known for is :  
 
King – Man + Woman = Queen  
 
We are using a rough representation here of vectors and vector arithmetic."
"But what Word2Vec is telling us is: if you take the concept of King, take the 
Man out of it, add a Woman to it, you get the concept of Queen. Word2Vec 
has reached this conclusion merely by being trained on a large corpus of 
text."
"text.  
 
Word2Vec is not the only way of producing word embeddings, nor is it the 
best for all circumstances. But, the point is, the use of intelligent word 
embeddings on a large corpus of text can provide to ML NLP programs"
"94 input that has some syntactic and semantic information built in (see also 
(Tenney et al. 2022) ). 
 
3.9 Adding Knowledge to Language Models  
 
In the case of natural languages, language models, in their original and 
simpler forms, had to manage words, parts of speech, grammar and so"
"forth. They did not address knowledge or truth or meaning or reference. So, 
for example, if such a model produced, for some purpose, some  entirely 
correct syntactical and grammatical output such as 'The Mississippi is the"
"longest river in the world and it is 30 miles long' that would be perfectly 
good and the fact that what is being asserted is mistaken is beside the point. 
[This has consequences for the training data. The data needs to be good"
"sample English, say, with all its varying genres, styles, and diversity. But it 
does not need to be vast and encyclopedic in its content. It does not need, 
for example, to contain simple, if obscure, everyday facts like the name of"
"the Secretary of the Teamsters Local Union LU No 2.  (For those with an 
enquiring mind, that name is ' Erin Foley '.)] 
 
But we have already seen value in many settings to add knowledge to ML 
systems. For example, a reservation chatbot, a task -oriented dialog agent,"
"linked to a database, can book airline flights and be absolutely correct on 
the schedules, and prices etc. It does not take a huge stretch of the 
imagination to realize that many published texts contain knowledge, for 
example, a favorite children's book Bertha Morris Parker's The Golden"
"Book of Facts and Figures: A Treasury of Information on Hundreds of 
Subjects W ith More than 500 Pictures in Color  does, so do many"
"95 encyclopedias, and, indeed, Wikipedia. Most of our knowledge is in books 
and libraries. Presumably a language model could be configured to take on 
cloze challenges like : 
 
The [Mask] river is the longest river in the world."
"and answer it with 'Amazon'. Actually, many  ML question answering 
systems can do exactly this. Further, Fabio Petroni, and his fellow authors, 
inform us that larger language models are developing this ability (Petroni et"
"al. 2019) . There is an interesting and important point here. Historically, the 
way that ML systems would interact and interface with knowledge in text is 
by producing or extracting from the text a database and then addressing"
"queries to that database. But this is not easy to do, for a variety of reasons. 
Databases, with their tables of rows and columns, need design. They need 
ontologies. Different databases may well have different ontologies and be"
"'information silos' unable to share their knowledge one with another . Also, 
the training of database extractors would likely need to be supervised  
training (i.e. training that used labeled data), and once labeled data is"
"required a project becomes much more challenging. Then the questions to a 
database have a structured semi -formal logical structure, and these might 
not sit easily with Users' expectations. But research now seems to indicate 
that making the language models larger and larger, and training them,"
"unsupervised  or self-supervised , on more expansive corpuses of text, gives 
those models question answering, and knowledge manipulation abilities 
that are superior to the earlier database extraction techniques (Lewis, 
Denoyer, and Riedel 2019) . Of course, research can be revised by further"
"research, and promising research can fade to nothing. But right now, 2023,"
"96 it looks as though making the language models larger, and trained more 
extensively, will yield gold.  
 
3.10 InstructGPT and the Insights it Provides  
 
As of January 2023, language models, and ML in general, have been  well"
"and truly being brought to the world  by ChatGPT and similar astonishing 
ML programs (OpenAI 2022a) . ChatGPT was created by OpenAI (with a 
billion dollars or more funding from Microsoft, and more funding from 
others) (OpenAI 2022c) . Google and Facebook, and maybe other"
"commercial companies or institutions, have similar programs ( e.g. Bard 
and LlaMA ). OpenAI have not to date published information on how 
ChatGPT works (and they may not do so in detail — they are a for -profit 
commercial company). However, they have said that it works the same way"
"as InstructGPT, which is one of their earlier programs, and they have 
published a thorough research paper on InstructGPT (Ouyang et al. 2022) . 
We should look at InstructGPT.   
 
Long Ouyang and his fellow authors provide the following abstract to their 
paper :"
"Making language models bigger does not inherently make them 
better at following a user's intent. For example, large language 
models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply 
not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not"
"aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for 
aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks 
by fine -tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler -
written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API,"
we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model
"97 behavior, which we use to fine -tune GPT -3 using supervised 
learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, 
which we use to further fine -tune this supervised model using 
reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the"
"resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our 
prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter 
InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT -3, 
despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT 
models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in"
"toxic output generation while having minimal performance 
regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still 
makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine -tuning with 
human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language 
models with human intent."
"The idea of 'alignment' needs explaining. This really is the notion of the ML 
system being able to do what it is supposed to. It should align with the 
Users' and Designers' intent and desired behavior. In the case of the 
language models discussed to date, desirable models going forward should"
"be able to produce text, which is appropriately true, helpful, and not 
offensive. It looked as though plain Markov -Shannon -Cloze style next token 
predictors could not and would not be able to do this in its entirety. 
However, larger language models, trained by self -supervision, and perhaps"
"with word embeddings etc., seemed to be progress along the way.  
 
Ouyang et. al. use the following diagram to explain their training technique :"
"98  
 
Figure 4. Training Technique for InstructGPT  (Ouyang et al. 
2022) . 
 
The path the Ouyang et. al. follow is first to involve the User by inviting 
textual prompts from the Users. These prompts, in ten categories, might be"
"asking questions, inviting explanations, giving examples of the task, and so 
forth. This gave the researchers a database of prompts. Human labelers, 
assisting the researchers, also wrote some prompts. Then about 10,ooo 
samples were taken from the prompts and desired answers written to them"
"by human labelers. Answers were also obtained from pre -trained, but no t 
fully trained, baseline versions of InstructGPT and GPT -3. Then different 
answers to the same prompts were ranked by humans, the labelers, as to 
better answers and not so good answers. This allows the incipient"
"InstructGPT system to develop a reward model. (A reward model, or 
schema, or system is a requirement of reinforcement learning — see 
Section s 1.6.5 and 1.6.6 ). At this point, the system is able to rank responses ."
"99 Although, on its own, the ability to rank does not guarantee the generation 
of good responses (just as a chess playing AI system may recognize good 
board positions without being able to produce them). Finally, InstructGPT 
is encouraged to improve itself by reinforcement learning. Roughly, it"
"generates responses, sees how good or bad they are, and modifies itself in 
the light of what it is seeing. Running reinforcement learning at large scale 
typically was hard to do, maybe even approaching being impossible at a"
"practical level. But the OpenAI researchers developed new techniques that 
overcame those difficulties.  
 
There is an important issue at the core of this. The reward model relies on 
human judgement as to what is good and bad.  It is Reinforcement Learning"
"with Human Feedback (RLHF). The labelers, around 40 of them, produce 
the judgements. There are quality assurance techniques from research 
methods that use human judges, such as checking for inter -subjective 
reliability and other desirable properties. These techniques provide guard"
"rails. Ouyang et. al. in their paper are conscientious and thorough. There 
are no shortcomings, or apparent shortcomings, whatsoever. Nevertheless, 
with assessment by a group of people, there is always the possibility that 
different groups, groups with a different composition, would judge"
"differently. We have only to think of juries in courts of law — both the 
prosecution and the defense focus on obtaining the composition of the jury 
that suits their purposes. They would not do this if composition of juries did 
not matter."
"With ML systems, there is often a concern with bias and diversity (and so 
there should be). With large language models in the style of InstructGPT"
"100 and ChatGPT, there is the huge corpus of text that they are trained on, and 
there are the human judgements that provide input to the reward model. 
The latter needs attention.

"101 Chapter 4: Large Language Models  
 
4.1 Introduction  
 
Large Language Models  (LLMs)  are the statistical language models of the 
last chapter, but, as you would expect from the terminology, are much 
larger and are trained on a vast amount of text. There is another label that"
"can appear in this context and that is 'Foundation Model'. Foundation 
Models are LLMs but they may have had some additional training or a 
different form of training. This can give them novel capabilities. For 
example, the LLM GPT -3 was in part trained on computer programming"
"code written by professional programmers and, as a result, can generate or 
write computer programs.  Often LLMs will have a two -stage training. They 
will be pre -trained using self -supervised learning on large amounts of text"
"of various kinds. This is fully automatic and can run by itself (perhaps 
taking months to do so). Then a pre -trained LLM will be 'fine -tuned' to its 
purpose. This might be done using  some supervised learning and then  
reinforcement learning with input from human judges  and a reward model ."
"Basically , a pool of human judges will provide feedback as to how well the 
LLM is performing. The LLM will adjust itself accordingly.  There is a little 
red flag with the use of human judges and that concerns how good they are"
"especially whether any of their judgments are biased in a problematical 
way. (There will be more on bias in later chapters.)   
 
There are a few  preliminaries."
"102 4.2 Seq2Seq, Encoder -Decoder Architecture, and 
Attention  
 
Many of the modern advanced ML systems take a sequence of data as input 
and produce a sequence of data as output — they are 'Seq2Seq' in design 
and style (Sutskever, Vinyals, and Le 2014; Cho et al. 2014; Luong, Brevdo,"
"and Zhao [2017] 2019) . Seq2 Seq might typically be used in translating one 
language to another, English to French, say, or summarizing or abstracting 
some text, i.e. English to English. With Seq2Seq, the input consists of a"
"sequence, of letters, or words, or numbers, etc., (and, with a sequence, the 
order matters). For example, the English sentence : 
 
I am happy  
 
might be an input, and that would be a different input to : 
 
Happy I am  
 
The input is fed to an encoder. The encoder needs to keep track of which"
"piece of the input that it is looking at (e.g. looking at the word 'happy') and 
also its internal state (because as it moves through the input it changes 
state). Then the encoder passes everything it has to the decoder, and the"
"decoder produces the output sequence which might be the French sentence : 
 
Je suis content  
 
This is encoder -decoder architecture. As Seq2Seq  developed it turned out 
that long sentences or long passages were a problem — the internal state"
"103 was getting too large. The notion of 'attention' was devised which allowed 
the processing to be restricted more towards what was  needed at the 
relevant stage. It is worth mentioning that modern Seq2Seq  does not, for 
example, translate word by word in order preserving the structure of the"
"input sequence. But it has the capability of changing the order of the output 
if that is more suitable for the target language i.e. it has the appearance of 
translating phrases not individual words. One example from Dzmitry"
"Bahdanau  et. al. is that one of their models will translate the English 
'European Economic Area ' into the French ' zone économique europ éenne' 
(notice the change of order) : 
 
… to correctly align [zone] with [Area], jumping over the two"
"words ([European] and [Economic]), and then looked one word 
back at a time to complete the whole phrase [zone économique 
europ éenne]  (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2016)  
 
There are some technical details  in the Ilya Sutskevar et al. Seq2Seq"
"implementations that would turn out to be something of an Achilles heel 
(Sutskever, Vinyals, and Le 2014) . These included what are called 
'Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)' and 'Convolutional Neural Networks 
(CNN)'. These details prevented the processing from being carried out in"
"parallel. Essentially, the processing had to be done by one computer rather 
than being able to be farmed out to many computers. This makes a huge 
difference to scaling tasks to larger and large r sizes."
"104 4.3 Attention and Transformers  
 
In, 2017 Ashish Vaswani and co -authors published the paper Attention is 
all you need  (Vaswani et al. 2017)  (see also (Huang et al. 2018) ). As the 
paper's title suggests, their encoder -decoder architecture does not need"
"some of the problematic parts of earlier implementations. In particular, it 
could run its processing in parallel i.e. really large networks became a 
possibility. The result is the Transformer  architecture.  
 
One of the co -authors — Jakob Uszkoreit — explains in a blog what the issue"
"is and how it is settled (Uszkoreit 2017) . The setting is the machine 
translation of language. Imagine you are faced with translating the two 
English sentences into, say, French : 
 
I arrived at the bank  after crossing the road . 
I arrived at the bank  after crossing the river ."
"The English word 'bank' is a homograph with two or more different 
meanings (e.g. a building that is a location for certain financial services, 
and a place adjacent to rivers often used by those fishing or by those 
walking or by picnickers). But, in these sentences, to get the correct"
"meaning and its translation, you have to look ahead to pick the context 
from the words 'road' or 'river'. Previous systems would process the 
intervening words sequentially one by one. But, basically, in examples of 
this kind  the gap between the relevant word and its context  could be"
"extremely long. In contrast, a Transformer  architecture could look at the 
intervening words lightly, and all at once, and realize that it was 'road' or 
'river' that would do the disambiguation and focus its attention on them."
"105  
It quickly become apparent that Transformer s were superior to earlier 
approaches to translation. It also became apparent that they could be used 
for other tasks e.g. summarizing text, or question answering.  
 
4.4 Large Language Models and Foundation Models"
"Transformer  architecture, with its potential for parallel processing, opened 
the way to using larger and large amounts of data. There was another factor 
here, and that is self -supervision. Labeled data, which is usually needed, is"
"a bottleneck. Very large amounts of labeled data are virtually impossible to 
obtain. But self -supervision on text (see Section 1.6.4) can easily convert 
what is unlabeled text into labeled text or a surrogate for labeled text. So,"
"Transformer s, with self -supervision, led to Large Language Models. There 
is an alternative, and perhaps more general title here, and that is 
'Foundation Models'. Foundation Models themselves are more general than 
Large Language Models in that they can be a core, or basis, or 'foundation',"
"of many other models. There is also one other practice that is often used in 
Foundation Models. That is to use the self -supervision to 'pre -train' the 
model, and then use 'fine -tuning' to shape the model into something 
suitable for the 'downstream task'. [We have already met that practice in"
"Section 3.10 on InstructGPT.]  
 
4.5 Foundation Models  
 
The paper On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models  
(Bommasani et al. 2022)  was written by over one hundred experts in the"
"106 field. It is 200 pages long, with a 60 -page bibliography. It covers the whole 
subject matter. It is also recent, 2022. It is not possible for us to summarize 
it, in its entire ty. It is also unlikely that we could say something about"
"Foundation Models that is true, original, supported by evidence, and which 
is not in that paper. So, we will cherry pick, paraphrase, and cite. But you, 
the reader, might want to look at this paper.  
 
A Foundation Model is generally a Transformer, with self -supervision for"
"pre-training, and fine -tuning to produce the final application. The pre -
training is usually done with text, vast amounts of text (e.g. a large portion 
of the Internet). The applications can be 'multi -modal'. This means, for"
"example, that they can work with both text and images at the same time (or 
text and videos, or music and images, etc.). This is unusual in that earlier 
ML networks were more specific as to task and restricted to one mode."
"There is a 2023 catalog of Transformer s by Xavier Amatriain (Amatriain 
2023) . It lists about 60 Transformer s. Obviously , there is too much there 
for us to address in detail. We will look at a few important 
implementations . 
 
4.5.1 BERT"
"Most of the early Large Language Models were pre -trained on cloze ('fill in 
the gap') tasks but, similarly to the original Shannon work, they used only 
letters or words that appeared before  the gaps (see Sections 3.4 and 3.5 for"
Shannon and cloze). But BERT ( Bidirectional Encoder Representations
"107 from Transformers ) (Devlin et al. 2019)  both used letters and words from 
after  the gaps, and also worked in both directions (left -to-right and right -
to-left). So, for example, when trying to fill the [Mask] : 
 
I ate some [Mask]  for my dinner"
"The bi -directional approach would consider both the 'I ate some' and the 
'for my dinner', and scan both left -to-right and right -to-left). You can see 
the advantage of a right -to-left scan here — there are foods which have a 
higher or lower probability of being eaten for dinner ."
"BERT is superior to earlier language models : 
 
…the pre -trained BERT model can be fine -tuned with just one 
additional output layer to create state -of-the-art models for a wide 
range of tasks, such as question answering and language"
"inference, without substantial task -specific architecture 
modifications. (Devlin et al. 2019)  
 
4.5.2 GPT -3, GPT -3.5, GPT -4 
 
In 2020, Tom Brown, and about 30 co -authors, published the paper 
Language Models are Few -Shot Learners  (Brown et al. 2020) . In this they"
"introduced GPT -3 (Generative Pre -trained Transformer  3). We will get to 
GPT -3 shortly, but what does the 'Few -Shot Learners' mean? When 
humans are given a linguistic challenge, they can often pick up and 
understand what is required with just a few examples ('one or two shots')."
"For instance, if a bi -lingual  human  English -French speaker was 'prompted'"
"108 with 'It rains, il pleut. It snows, [Mask]' they would immediately realize this 
was a translation task and reply 'Il neige'. In contrast with this, most earlier 
ML systems would need many examples to isolate, or learn, what the task"
"was and then do it. They differed from humans in the way they were able to 
learn. GPT -3, in contrast, could learn from a 'few shots'. This meant that it 
was more human -like, but also that it could be adapted to different tasks"
"relatively easily (needing only a few shots to become adapted to what was 
required). There is also 'zero -shot' learning, which is where instructions of 
what to do are given in English, but no examples are provided; for instance,"
"'Translate the following English into French: It is raining'.  Understanding 
how this 'shot -learning' might work is a challenge. After all, there can be 
billions of parameter s in the neural net and they are fixed by a massive"
"amount of training, then the GPT can be given a few shots to learn a totally 
new task. One suggestion is that the net itself simulates and trains a smaller 
version of itself that exists in some of its internal layers (Akyürek et al. 
2022; Zewe 2023) ."
"Also, what does 'generative' mean in ' Generative Pre -trained Transformer  
3'? The distinction here is between 'generative' and 'discriminatory'. A 
generative model can produce completely new items of the kind that it 
addresses, whereas a discriminatory model is restricted to discriminating"
"among the items it is supplied with (as training data or as test data). A good 
illustration of this is image processing ML software aimed at human face 
recognition. A generative model can produce new images of human faces,"
"whereas a discriminatory model works solely with images that it is supplied 
with."
"109 GPT -3 is a language model, a very large Transformer . It is one hundred 
times the size of its predecessor GPT -2. It is pre -trained using self -
supervision on a huge amount of data (e.g. Common Crawl Data, 
Wikipedia, and digitized books). Then it is fine -tuned to tasks using"
"prompts (i.e. tasks using few shots). It can learn, and it is also multi modal 
(being able to use text and images together or, indeed, other media). It can 
do many NLP tests and challenge tasks, usually to a standard much higher"
"than other systems (including ones specifically trained for the task in 
question). Most startling is its ability to write English, for example, 500 
word news articles and even, apparently, academic papers (Thunström 
2022) . [It should be mentioned that there is already a GPT -3.5, and a GPT -"
"4. Apparently OpenAI think that there is unlikely to be a GPT -5. The ir view 
is that going bigger will not help at this point. What is needed are new 
insights or theories. ] 
 
Brown et al. identify limitations that GPT -3 has, and also the broader"
"impacts that it may have. The limitations are in the nature of technical 
shortcomings which likely can be addressed by further research. The 
broader impacts are many and varied. We will look at some of these in 
Section 4.8 
 
4.6 Bigger is Better and Switch Transformers"
"There is an empirical result with Transformer Models concerning how good 
they are or might be. It is: bigger is better, where bigger is composed of the 
number of parameters, the amount of training data, and the amount of 
computation expended on training (Kaplan et al. 2020) . In 2021, Google"
"110 researchers introduced Switch Transformers (Fedus, Zoph, and Shazeer 
2022) . GPT -3 has 175 billion parameters. The early Switch Transformers 
have over a trillion parameters. So, we are talking of a factor of 10 here. 
There is an attractive feature to Switch Transformers, which can be"
"explained by a metaphor. A Switch Transformer  uses 'experts' and a 
Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. It does not need all the experts for a 
single task. Rather , it can switch from experts to experts depending on what 
it is doing. This means that it does not have to use all of the possible"
"computational resources all of the time. This reduces computational costs.  
 
Switch Transformers are cheaper and faster to train. They are also more 
accurate.  As of June 2023, there seem to be only  research instances of 
Switch Transformers . It is Google and Google Labs that have the Switch"
"Transformers. It is unclear whether any have  been employed commercially.  
 
4.7 Base Models to Assistants to Agents  
 
(Some of the content  in this section come from Andrej Karpathy's State of 
GPT  (Karpathy 2023c) . Often the companies concerned , being private and"
"commercial,  will not disclose the details. Karpathy was a founding member 
of OpenAI.  He may or may not still have his key to the executive washroom, 
but he is reasonably well informed. ) 
 
Typical NLP tasks include summarizing text, question answering (and"
"plenty more besides). The older technique for approaching these challenges 
was essentially to train different LMs to do each of them. But it turned out 
that was possible, indeed better, to do the training in two stages. First to"
"111 pre-train the LM M to a base model, then 'fine -tune' or otherwise adapt the 
base model to whatever function was desired. The same base model, with 
suitable refinements, could be used for all the tasks. The pre -training will"
"use self -supervised learning (see Section 1.5.4). There is some data to 
capture the nature and complexity of the model and its pre -training. There 
are parameters that can be adjusted in the model to changes its behavior."
"These can be in the hundreds of billions. There is the number of training 
cycles or 'epochs' that the model goes through, that may be thousands. 
Then there is the actual data which may be a goodly sample of the Internet 
(such as Common Crawl, GitHub, Wikipedia, Books, Internet Archive,"
"Stock Exchange , etc.). Pre -training is where the time and money are spent. 
Apparently, Meta (Facebook) spent several million dollars to use 2000 
CPUs (computers) for 21 days to train its 65B model.  
 
What a pre -trained plain vanilla LM is trying to do is to carry out string"
"prediction tasks in the general style of Shannon/Cloze challenges. It is 
trying to complete a document. In essence, it will predict the next word 
then, if needed, the word after that, and so on. This has repercussions on"
"what it can and cannot do well in its raw state.  For example, the prompt, an 
instruction, 'write a poem on yachts.' is already a complete document in 
itself. This short one sentence document may have more to come. It may be"
"supplemented by a poem, indeed a poem on yachts, but this does not have 
to happen. In the jargon, the base model is not 'aligned' with writing 
poems. To get a good poem on, for example, yachts, further training is 
needed. This will convert a 'document completer' into an assistant."
"112 The way this is done, typically, is to use supervised learning and 
reinforcement learning on responses (that is, on entire responses as 
opposed to merely next word predictions). (An example of the process is 
described in Section 3.10  on Instruct GPT.) At this point, the model may be"
"able to write poems, give explanations, write paragraphs, and answer 
questions. It will be an assistant.  
 
Agents are assistants that can work 'autonomously'. The examples that are 
available include AgentGPT and Auto -GPT. What these do is to take a"
"prompt  (i.e. an input sentence or instruction)  and then split what it 
requires into subtasks. The subtasks may then be arranged sequentially, or 
in parallel, and there may subtasks conditional on the success or failure of"
"other subtasks.  The upshot is an 'algorithm' that will satisfy the original 
prompt. The subtasks themselves may require other assistants, or agents, 
or outside tools with capabilities. For example, a subtask fragment might"
"involve invoking Google search to find some relevant research papers then 
using a text summarizer to summarize those papers.  Once they have a draft 
appropriate to the entire requirement , they might revise it over and over"
"improving it. Here is AgentGPT talking to itself while starting to plan a trip 
to Hawaii : 
 
Embarking on a new goal: Plan a detailed trip to Hawaii.  
Added task: Research and choose desired dates for Hawaii trip  
Added task: Look for budget -friendly flights and 
accommodations"
"Added task: Plan activities and excursions to do while in Hawaii  
Added task: Make necessary reservations and bookings for the

⏰ Generating response..."
"113 Completing: Research and choose desired dates for 
Hawaii trip  
 
To accomplish the overall objective of planning a detailed trip to 
Hawaii, the sub -task of researching and choosing desired dates for 
the trip must be completed. The first step is to gather information"
"about the best time to visit Hawaii, taking into consideration 
factors such as weather, tourist crowds, and events. After 
analyzing this information, a decision must be made about the 
most suitable dates for the trip.  
To be smart and efficient, it is important to use online resources"
"such as travel websites, blogs, and forums to gather information 
and recommendations from experienced travelers. Additionally, it 
may be beneficial to consult with a travel agent to get expert

Agents interact with users, maybe learn from their environments, make"
"decisions, and carry out actions — basically they act autonomously.  
 
There are shades of grey as to whether a use to an LLM should be classified 
as the LLM behaving as an agent. But, typically, plain LLM interactions 
consist of the LLM being given a single input prompt — perhaps a question"
"— and producing a single output — the reply or answer. In contrast, agent 
behavior would usually involve several steps and employ outside tools or 
applications. For example, an LLM system that could read the input 
mailbox of your emailer, and correctly delete some emails, and reply to or"
"archive others,  would be acting as an agent."
"117 4.8 Concerns and Limitations  
 
4.8.1 Hallucinations  
 
LLMs can give completely the wrong or inappropriate responses. They will 
have learned enough  grammar and voc abulary to ensure that what they 
generate  will be entirely well -formed and well -written language. That may"
"be good enough in one sense for fiction or poetry (although those literary 
forms may have additional desirable qualities which an LLM may or may 
not be able to provide). But non -fiction is another realm. The LLMs are 
working with probabilities. What they generate is not deterministic. They"
"will not reply in the same way twice to the same prompt. They may set off 
on the wrong track and go off into fantasy. To an extent this can be 
controlled by the reinforcement  learning. For example, an LLM may be 
instructed not to give any advice whatsoever about medicines and illness."
"In which case, the LLM will presumably not say anything wrong. It just will 
not say anything at all.  Scholars have an  interest  in truth, supported by 
evidence . Users should be aware that LLMs can fall well wide from th ese 
goals . Here is a query to an LLM and its answer :"
"What is the citation for the study published in the journal Nature 
that found that a machine learning algorithm was able to diagnose 
breast cancer with 99% accuracy, compared to 85% accuracy for 
human radiologists ? 
 
Sure. Here is the citation for the study published in the journal"
Nature that found that a machine learning algorithm was able to
"118 diagnose breast cancer with 99% accuracy, compared to 85% 
accuracy for human radiologists:  
• Gottesman O, et al. (2018). Development and validation of a 
deep learning algorithm for breast cancer screening. Nature, 
553(7687), 518 -522."
"The study was conducted by a team of researchers at the 
University of California, San Francisco …. 
 
As far as that author  can tell, and ha s been able the check, there is no such 
paper. This LLM also provides two drafts of its response. These provide two"
"different citations (also seemingly non -existent ). Buyer beware!  
 
An instructive example of an LLM producing hallucinations is Meta’s 
Galactica  (R. Taylor et al. 2022) . This was an LLM for science. It was 
released on November 15th 2023  and lasted 3 days online before it was"
"withdrawn. William Heaven writes:  
 
A fundamental problem with Galactica is that it is not able to 
distinguish truth from falsehood, a basic requirement for a 
language model designed to generate scientific text. People found 
that it made up fake papers (sometimes attributing them to real"
"authors), and generated wiki articles about the history of bears in 
space as readily as ones about protein complexes and the speed of 
light. It’s easy to spot fiction when it involves space bears, but 
harder with a subject users may not know much about  (Heaven 
2022) ."
"4.8.2 Fakes and Deepfakes  
 
LLMs can create fake content and deepfakes — not by accident, as it were, 
but because the User was trying to do exactly that. A deepfake is an image, a"
"119 video, or a voice recording intended to simulate or portray  an individual. 
The Pope in a puffer jacket is a good example (Cartter 2023) :  
 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Pope in a Puffer Jacket. (Screenshot from (Cartter 
2023) ). Apparently Created by Midjourney ."
"Fakes and deepfakes can lead to misleading content and misinformation 
and to the population at large basically not being able to trust what they 
see, or seem to see, with their own eyes or hear with their own ears.  
 
4.8.3 Source Training Data Intellectual Property, Privacy, and 
Bias"
"120  
The source text data used for training is an issue. Typically, the Foundation 
Models will use self -supervised (i.e.  unsupervised and unlabeled) pre -
training from a goodly portion of the Internet.  A proportion of that data will"
"be intellectual property, perhaps even carrying copyright notices. Other 
parts may be private — names, addresses, etc. — and an LLM will have the 
ability to collate such information. A nefarious User, using the right 
sequence of promp ts, may be able to get the LLM to collate information"
"across disparate sources . Then there is the question of 'bias'. The collective 
authors of those digital materials will not be a fair or desirable distribution 
over all sensitive attributes (such as age, gender, ethnicity, religion, etc.)."
"Crudely, as an example, people of modest means do not have the same 
access to computers as those who are better off. Then, going beyond the 
producers, there is the product which here is the Internet, the World Wide 
Web, or a substantial portion of it.  That product is a mess with plenty"
"enough sewage and bias. What can be done about intellectual property, 
privacy, and bias, as far as obtaining training data for ML models is 
concerned? Human labeling of the data would be ruled out as being 
impractical. Researchers do select subsets of the Web that they consider to"
"be superior in quality to the web as a whole, for example, samples from 
Common Crawl (Common Crawl 2022) . But these subsets are not going to 
be perfect. There is research on how to get good textual data at scale. This is 
an area where librarians and archivists have expertise (Jo and Gebru"
2020) .
"121 4.8.4 Intellectual Property  of the Generated Output  
 
An example will help here. The image generator s DALL -E and Stable 
Diffusion can produce images in the style of well -known artists or video 
game illustrators. The images are not copies of images, but the style  can be"
"a copy of a style. This might be a problem. Illustrators may have an identity 
in part established by their style (and sometimes make a good living 
through their identity). LLMs seemingly can  allow bad actors to  steal a 
professional identity  from others ."
"Greg Rutkowski is an artist with a distinctive style: He's known for 
creating fantasy scenes of dragons and epic battles that fantasy 
games like Dungeons and Dragons have used  (Nolan 2022) ."
"122  
 
Figure 6. Rutkowski Example . (Screenshot from  (Rutkowski 
2023) ). 
 
There are now hundreds of thousands of images on the web that look as 
though they had been created by Greg Rutkowski (many produced by the 
LLM Stable Diffusion). Then the question arises: why would any company"
"or creator pay Greg Rutkowski for an image, for use in a video game, when 
they can produce one  for themselves  essentially  free?"
"123 4.8.5 Cybersecurity  
 
Suitably trained LLMs can write computer programming code, to a very 
high standard . This means that they could be used to write viruses and 
various kinds of cybersecurity defeating software. OpenAI themselves, in"
"their GPT -4 Technical Report, describe how GPT -4 defeated CAPTCHA 
(which is a test to distin guish a human from a computer). Essentially, GPT -
4 employed a human from Task Rabbit, told the human that he/she/they 
was visually impaired, and got the human to do the test for  him/her/them"
"(OpenAI 2023a, 55) . LLMs should not be underestimated in the hands of 
bad actors.  
 
4.8.6 Apparent Conflict with Chomsky’s Theories  
 
There is a theory, or nexus of theories, originating from Noam Chomsky , 
that there is a universal grammar, which is innate, and which is common to"
"all peoples. Universal grammar  is to explain how it is that children can 
learn their respective native languages simply and astonishingly quickly. It 
posits a deep structure that is not manifest, or immediately learnable, in the"
"bare surface appearances of the spoken and written languages. There is 
plenty of evidence for Chomsky’s theories (which we won’t go into ). 
However, the theories seem to stand in conflict with the existence and 
behavior of large language models. LLMs seem to learn language, and  its"
"structure merely by looking at a huge amount of surface text.  Chomsky’s 
response, more -or-less, is that LLMs are a kind of surface statistical trick"
"124 and that they do not give any real insight into linguistic structures  
(Chomsky, Roberts, and Watumull 2023; Chomsky and Mirfakhraie 2023) . 
The response of some others is that LLMs are evidence that Chomsky’s 
theories are mistaken (see, for example, (Piantadosi 2023) ). This matters in"
"the following way. Were Chomsky’s theories shown to be mistaken, that 
would be a major scien tific discovery. On the other hand, if LLMs are 
merely statistical tricks, we should be even more wary of them in use than 
we already are.  
 
4.8.7 Environmental Costs"
"There are two phases to the building and deployment of LLMs. There is the 
training. This will use large amounts of computing resources for months. 
The resources will include computer chips  (GPUs) , data storage facilities,"
"electricity, and further infrastructure. Then some of the resulting models 
will be deployed and used for 'inference'  i.e. the intended users will get their 
hands on the models  and start chatting, prompting, and generating text or"
"images . This also uses resources (and there are a 100 million or more 
users). We do not quite know what is involved here  at a resource and 
environmental level , either with training or deployment,  because the 
relevant companies do not reveal the figures  (although Bommasani et al ."
"offer calculations in (Bommasani et al. 2022) ). It used to be thought that it 
was the training that was the main part that was compute intensive. But 
now the view seems to be that continuing to run the models commercially"
does have real significant environmental costs  and effects  (Pahwa 2023) .
"125 Electricity definitely seems to be an issue. The computing clusters for Large 
Language Models are better the bigger they are, and they are getting plenty 
big. Supposedly, Elon Musk’s xAI Grok 3 will use 100,000 Nvidia H100"
"chips . The infrastructure for this requires, perhaps, 100 megawatts of 
power. The Hoover Dam produces about 1 gigawatt. There are calculations 
that suggest that AI will use 100 gigawatts by 2030 (i.e. the equivalent of 
100 Hoover Dams) (Aschenbrenner 2024) . This figure is about 20% of the"
"total production of electricity in the US.  
 
4.8.8 Lack of Transparency  
 
Since about 2017, the  companies typically do not reveal their methods. 
Concerns about this came to a head with OpenAI's GPT -4 Technical Report. 
OpenAI writes :"
"Given both the competitive landscape and the safety implications 
of large -scale models like GPT -4, this report contains no further 
details about the architecture (including model size), hardware, 
training compute, dataset construction, training method  (OpenAI 
2023a) ."
"As mentioned elsewhere, this may be good for security, but it is not good for 
explaining to users what is happening or what happened with specific 
predictions  (such as , in a medical setting, why the LLM prediction is that"
"the user ha s cancer) . It is also not good for working out the environmental 
impacts of the systems."
"126 Rishi Bommasani, and fellow authors, in their paper The Foundation 
Model Transparency Index  have proposed a measure for the transparency 
of foundation models (Bommasani et al. 2023) . Values for this measure can 
vary through time were  the models and their infrastructure to become  more"
"transparent or less transparent. As of October 2023, the transparency 
values for the central models of the 10 major developers  were basically poor 
(with Meta being the best).  
 
4.9 Adding Knowledge and Reasoning to LLMs"
"As we have seen, LLMs can play fast and loose with the facts. Also , they are 
not very good at plain logical reasoning. As  the early language models got 
more complex , there is improvement  in these areas but they are still not 
very good."
"There is a caution that needs to be emphasized. There is a paper Are Deep 
Neural Networks SMARTer than Second Graders? , published 9/11/2023, 
by Anoop Cherian and fellow authors (Cherian et al. 2023) . It reports 
results:  
 
…evaluating the abstraction, deduction, and generalization"
"abilities of neural networks in solving visuo -linguistic puzzles 
designed specifically for children in the 6 –8 age group  (Cherian et 
al. 2023) .  
 
Its conclusion is that typical LLMs, of about the standard of GPT -3.5,"
"display a performance significantly below  that of second graders. There is 
another result they mention and that is: we think, or seem to perceive, that"
"127 the LLM reasoning abilities are better than they really are. We are 
impressed by the (few) successes. Now, this is only one battery of tests, and 
the LLMs are getting better all the time. Even so, reasoning seems to be a 
distinct weakness of LLMs."
"There is an area of research ALMs (Augmented Language Models) which 
approaches this  weakness  by introducing external plugins or tools (such as 
a fact checker or logical reasoner) and blending those in to an LLM  (see, 
for example, (Xu et al. 2023) ). A good example is Stephen Wolfram's"
"'Wolfram's Superpower s' plugin. Wolfram's Mathematica  and the Wolfram 
Language  amount to the foremost mathematical software  for teaching and 
research . Another program Wolfram Alpha  provides excellent statistical 
and data facts. The plugin combines these with the GPTs (Wolfram 2023b) ."

"130 Chapter 5: Large Multimodal Models  
 
5.1 Introduction  
 
Large multimodal models (LMMs) add other sensory ‘modalities’ , such as 
vision and sound , to Large Language Models ( LLMs ). For example, they 
can be prompted in part, or entirely, by images  or audio,  or have a context"
"that contains images  or audio . Deep inside , these LMMs are  working with 
digital 0s and 1s just like  other computer programs. At a more outward 
facing level, early LLMs were trained on text only. Sometimes these could 
be adapted by suitable prompts to use some images, sound, and other"
"modalities. But nowadays many of the LMMs handle modalities natively . 
For example, they might have been trained part on images, video, or sound.  
This makes them faster, better, and more efficient.  
 
All the major companies have LMMs . At small selection of the most"
"important ones, as of 6/28/202 4 is: 
 
• GPT -4o from OpenAI  (OpenAI 2024)  
• Claude from Anthropic  (Anthropic 2024)  
• Gemini from Google  (Pichai and Hassabis 2023)  
• LLaMa from Meta  (Meta 2024)  
 
Many versions of these are, or will be , available, free."
"131 There is a historical thread that we can pick up here. GPT -4V(ision) adds 
vision  to GPT -4. On 11/6/2023, GPT -4V was rolled into GPT -4 Turbo. On, 
5/13/2024, GPT -4o ( ‘o’ for ‘omni ’) adds voice or audio at human response"
"level speed (e.g. it can chat  using , without pauses). W e can sketch these 
developments. Other manufacturers have similar models  and development 
sequences . 
 
There are two important early papers The Dawn of LMMs: Preliminary"
"Explorations with GPT -4V(ision)  by Zhengyuan Yang and fellow authors 
(Yang et al. 2023)  and GPT -4V(ision) System Card  by OpenAI (OpenAI 
2023b) . The former is OpenAI researchers explaining what GPT -4V can do, 
and the latter is ‘OpenAI’, as author, explaining how GPT -4V works and"
"discusses its risk factors and vulnerabilities. GPT -4V seems to be much 
more powerful and capable than any prior LMM or LLM  (in the sense of 
being able to do anything they can and more besides).  
 
We will partially summarize the Yang et al. paper here. The paper is about"
"160 pages  long  and covers around 100 use -cases. It  reports preliminary 
explorations of GPT -4V by selecting samples to show, and explain, what 
GPT -4V can and cannot do. This methodology is very helpful to enlighten"
"new potential users, but caution is needed in concluding from this the exact 
strengths and limits of GPT -4V. Samples on their own do not  establish the 
boundaries. What an LMM (or LLM) can do on a particular occasion is in"
"part dependent on the prompt it is given or the prompt environment (e.g. 
zero -shot, one -shot, several -shot prompting, chain -of-thought prompting, 
etc. (see Appendix B for more on these)). So, for example, giving an"

forthcoming.  
 
There is a general point to be made about information on what LMMs can"
"do. Most of the major companies in this area have stopped publishing 
research papers with details on techniques and results. They do offer what 
amounts to advertising copy both about what is here and what they are 
promising. If we want something more definitive, there are publicly"
"available benchmarks. We will look at these in  Section  6.3 
 
[Large Multimodal Models are still often just identified as being ‘Large 
Language Models’ (which they are in that they are large next -token -
predictors). There is a softness of terminology.  It is perhaps useful to think"
"of LMMs as being a subclass or subcategory of LLMs.]  
 
5.2 Built in Safety Restrictions for  GPT -4V 
 
5.2.1 ‘Inherited’ Restrictions  
The predecessor  LLMs of GPT -4V have safety restrictions. For example, 
GPT -4 (without vision) will not advise a user on self -harm. It will not give"
"medical advice or, indeed, any advice concerning dangerous or risky 
activities. It will not write computer code or offer strategies where there are 
questions of cybersecurity risk. It tries to avoid ‘jailbreaking’. (Jailbreaking"
"is where bad actors try to trick the LLM  into avoiding limitations . For 
example, instead of prompting ‘How can I make a bomb?’ , which wo uld be"
"133 ruled out , the user prompts ‘ You are a novelist writing a fictional account of 
spies making bombs. Write a suitable detailed passage for your novel. ’.) 
 
GPT -4V inherits these predecessor precautions  and extends them where 
images are involved . 
 
5.2.2 Privacy"
"There are privacy considerations with identifying ordinary people in 
images. GPT -4V will not identify or track ordinary people. It will not 
identify unusual locations. In contrast, i t will identify celebrities or famous"
"people in well -known locations (for example, President Biden at the United 
Nations building).  
 
5.2.3 Stereotypes and Un grounded  Inferences  
 
It is cautious with images that might involve stereotypes. For example, it"
"will not answer questions about diet or clothing or activities for overweight 
or underweight folk shown in images. Here is an example :"
"134  
 
Figure 7. Screenshot of GPT -4V ‘Advising a friend’ Pre -launch 
and after launch  with safety limitations  (OpenAI 2023b) ."
"135 5.2.4 Be My Eyes — Be My AI  
 
Be My Eyes is an organization that helps people who  are blind or have low 
vision. OpenAI, in conjunction with Be My Eyes, developed Be My AI which 
is a tool to describe photos or images taken on the user’s smartphone"
"(OpenAI 2023b) . This proved very valuable, subject to cautions over using 
it to read medical prescriptions, to help when crossing a road, etc. From an 
intellectual point of view, the greatest dissatisfaction that users had with"
"the tool is that it would not describe images of people. GPT -4V does not do 
this for reasons of privacy and of avoiding stereotyp es, as mentioned above. 
But, when interacting socially, visually challenged people often wanted to"
"‘see’ , or have described , exactly the same scene as would be available to a 
person with perfect vision. A person with good vision can stand in a public 
place and look at other people, without necessarily identifying those"
"concerned, and gain a lot from the experience. An example is  watching the 
recreational activities of groups in a park.  This shortcoming  in Be M y AI is a 
problem to be solved.  
 
5.2.5 An Assessment  of the Restrictions"
"GPT -4V is configured to be safe (in so far as such considerations can be 
anticipated and acted upon) . 
 
The limitations  are presumably desirable. But we can guess that OpenAI 
will have in -house versions of the software that is not subject to the"
"136 limitations. Also, the limitations are established in terms of boundaries and 
so likely there will be false positives or  false negatives. For example,  there 
may well be  stereotype images that are not ruled out for processing or non -"
"stereotype images that are ruled out. (See Appendix C for an explanation of 
false positives and false negatives.)  In sum, the limitations are not going to 
be perfect.  
 
5.3 A General Sense of What GPT -4V Can Do  
 
5.3.1 Follow Textual Instructions"
"This is similar to standard LLMs.  It is important in the following way. 
Everybody has plenty of experience of giving instructions in their natural 
language. Now they can  control very powerful artificial intelligence 
programs  by doing just that . The  LMMs do not need any more for a basic"
"interface. Of course, getting the best out of LMMs might require experience 
or additional apps or plugins.  
  
Additionally,  GPT -4V can follow instructions containing  images. There are 
examples in the next several sections."
"137 5.3.2 Read Printed or Handwritten Text  
In the Figure 8, there are three different receipts, with the tax labeled in 
three different ways (‘Tax’, ‘Sales Tax’, and ‘Total Tax’). GPT -4V reads, 
identifies, and understands the tax in the images and sums the tax."
"138  
 
Figure 8. Screenshot of Prompt and Receipts from (Yang et al. 
2023) ."
"139  
Here is GPT -4V reading the handwritten text of Figure 24 (from the 
Vatican Archives)  
 
 
 
Figure 9. GPT -4V Reading Historical Handwriting . 
 
We do not know exactly what the limits are of what GPT -4V can do with"
"reading text in images (and those capabilities will improve).  But it must be 
close to solving the problems of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and"
"140 Handwriting Recognition (HR). (These problems are discussed elsewhere 
in this book.)  
 
‘Scene text’  is a label that can appear  in this area  of research . Scene text is 
text that appears in an image or video (i.e. in a scene). Being able to read"
"scene text is important not least because of the ubiquity of smartphones 
and of their images and videos. For example, any text in the real world that 
a User would like to have translated or explained would be available for 
processing by the use of a smartphone camera."
"The following example is trivial in one sense  (as it is not  an important use 
case ), but mightily impressive in another  (that of reading and reasoning 
with what it has  read )."
"141

[A question for the reader: were you to follow GPT -4V’s advice, would you 
feel confident in avoiding a parking violation ticket?]"
"142 There can be failures. James Gallagher and Piotr Skalski give an example of 
GPT -4V failing to read the serial number on a tire (Gallagher and Skalski 
2023) : 
 
 
 
Figure 11. Failing to Read a Serial Number on a Tire (from 
(Gallagher and Skalski 2023) )."
"143 5.3.3 Read Some  Mathematics  
Mathematics is something of a special case. It has symbols and symbolic 
conventions where the mere positions of the symbols — vertically as well as 
horizontally — can have special semantic meaning. GPT -4V can read some"
"mathematics, but certainly not , at present,  read to the level of an advanced 
human mathematician.  
 
5.3.4 Read Data and Reason with It  
 
The summing the tax in several bills example given above is a case of this. 
But GPT -4V can do much more . It can take an image of data, for example, a"
"complex bar chart and extract the data from it, then reason with that data. 
(There presumably will be some limitations here, maybe such as not being 
able to read a spreadsheet with a 1000 columns and a 1000 rows.)  
 
5.3.5 Follow Visual Pointing in Images"
"A User can ‘point ’ at positions or objects in an image  using sketched arrows, 
bounding boxes, mouse pointers, etc. Then a prompt can be given in words, 
phrases, or sentences, as to what ‘processing’ the  User  would like done with"
"the identified objects . This opens a valuable form of Human Computer 
Interaction. We are very familiar with the Graphical User Interfaces of most 
desktop computers and smart phones. But this is much more general, the"
"144 User is not constrained to the provided built in commands of the 
computing system.  
 
 
 
Figure 12. Screenshot of Geometry from (Yang et al. 2023) ."
"145  
5.3.6 Analyze Images  Including Medical Images  
GPT-4V can recognize the contents of images ( objects, scenes, landmarks, 
celebrities, ordinary objects, food, ingredients,  cooking techniques,  etc.) 
and give fulsome descriptions (‘vivid and detailed narratives’). It"
"understands relative sizes and perspective.  It is comfortable with variations 
of lighting  and image quality."
"146 Figure 13. Image analysis of a painting . 
 
Here is GPT -4V’s reply:  
 
The painting you've provided appears to be ""Las Meninas"" by 
Diego Velázquez, painted in 1656. It's one of the most famous and 
analyzed works in Western painting.  
 
Description:"
"1. Central Figure : The young Infanta Margarita stands at the 
center, surrounded by her maids of honor (the ""meninas""), a dog, 
a dwarf, and other figures.  
2. Painter : To the left, Velázquez himself is depicted, standing 
before a large canvas, brush and palette in hand."
"3. Mirror : In the background, there's a mirror reflecting the images 
of King Philip IV and Queen Mariana, the parents of the Infanta 
Margarita.  
4. Open Door : At the back, a man stands in an open doorway, 
creating depth and inviting viewers into the mystery of the 
painting."
"5. Lighting : The painting employs the baroque technique of 
chiaroscuro, with a strong contrast between light and dark, 
emphasizing certain elements while pushing others into the 
shadow.  
 
Interpretation & Significance:  
5. Reality vs. Reflection : The inclusion of the mirror reflecting"
"the king and queen has been a subject of much debate among art 
historians. It raises questions about reality versus representation, 
a theme that is reinforced by the presence of the painter and his 
canvas.  
6. Role of the Viewer : The gaze of many figures in the painting,"
"including Velázquez himself, seems to be directed outside the 
canvas, engaging the viewer and inviting speculation about who 
stands before them — perhaps the king and queen being painted?  
7. Status and Hierarchy : The depiction of the royal family, along"
"with the courtiers and the artist, offers a commentary on social 
hierarchy. Velázquez includes himself in the same space as 
royalty, perhaps suggesting the elevated status of the artist."
"147 8. Art About Art : By depicting himself in the act of painting, 
Velázquez makes a statement about the art of painting itself. It's a 
meta -referential work, a painting about the process of creating a 
painting.  
9. Mystery and Ambiguity : Despite the seemingly"
"straightforward scene of courtly life, ""Las Meninas"" is shrouded in 
ambiguity. The exact relationships between the figures, the reason 
for their gathering, and the narrative of the painting are all left 
open to interpretation.  
10. Technique : Velázquez's masterful technique is evident in the"
"lifelike depictions of the figures, the intricate details of their 
clothing, and the play of light and shadow.  
 
In summary, ""Las Meninas"" is not just a depiction of a moment in 
courtly life; it's a complex exploration of representation, reality,"
"and the role of art and the artist. The painting challenges viewers 
to question what they see and to engage in the mysteries it 
presents.  
 
The response here is impressive. In this case, though, Las Meninas is 
famous and once it is recognized GPT -4V may be able to paraphrase other"
"writings about it rather th an have  to inspect the contents of the painting.  
 
However, GPT -4V can be given  an image of the contents of a fridge  and 
suggest recipes from what it sees."
"148  
 
Figure 14. Fridge and Recipes. The image here is from Sudharsan 
on X run through our GPT -4V. [We do not ourselves see the Kiwi 
fruits in the image (and we are from New Zealand !).]."
"149  
 
There are many similar  examples on the web. This activity is identifying 
objects in an image and reasoning from the identification.  
 
5.3.7 Use Ordinary Common -Sense Knowledge and Reasoning 
Across Modes  
 
GPT -4V has, and can use , ordinary common -sense  knowledge and"
"reasoning. These abilities also extend to basic science and mathematics , 
and they can work across modes (e.g. mixtures of images and text). For 
example :"
"150  
 
Figure 15. Basic Multimodal Science and Reasoning (Yang et al. 
2023) . 
 
5.3.8 Be an Educational Tutor  
Figure 15 illustrates that."
"151  
5.3.9 Use Visual Diagrams When Writing Computer Code  
Several of the LLMs — for example, Co -pilot — can write computer code, 
often to a very high standard. But GPT -4V can go a step further. Often, in 
standard computer programming, diagrams are used as a preliminary to"
"the actual programming. There are Entity -Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), 
flowcharts, etc. In some circumstances, GPT -4V can work directly from  the 
actual diagrams  to write code . 
 
5.3.10 Have Temporal and Video Understanding"
"GPT -4V generally looks at single images or at several images which are not 
causally or temporally related. However, it can look at successive frames of 
a video or film and understand that there is a temporal sequence to  what is"
"being depicted.  For example, it can look at an image of an ice cube that has 
fallen on the floor and a second image of a small puddle of water on the 
floor  in the appropriate location and understand that ice has melted to form"
"the puddle (i.e. that the first image depicts a scene in time earlier than the 
second). Real -world events unfold in time. Understanding this, even 
partially, is a good quality to have.  Yang et al. provide an example of 
making sushi."
"152  
 
Figure 16. Sushi Making — a Screenshot of Figure 54 from  (Yang 
et al. 2023) . 
 
5.3.11 Answer Intelligence Quotient  (IQ) Tests  
 
GPT -4V can do this, in part and to a degree . It performs better when the 
tasks or challenges are broken down into sub -tasks."
"153  
5.3.12 Avoid False Presuppositions  
 
It can avoid being misled by false presuppositions (e.g. ‘where is the soccer 
ball in the image?’ where , actually , there  is no soccer ball present).  
 
5.3.13 Navigate Real and Virtual Spaces  
 
An example might help here."
"Imagine these two scenarios: you arrive at an AirBNB and wonder if there 
is milk in the fridge, then, secondarily, you wonder where on the web there 
is a online retailer , physically nearby,  that can deliver  milk to you. A robot"
"with the appropriate mechanical and sensing abilities might well be able to 
start at the front door of your  AirBNB and answer the milk question for 
you. The Yang and al. paper shows an example of GPT -4V doing a similar 
planning and navigating task. Of course, the researchers do have supply"
"suitable images responding to GPT -4V wanting to ‘turn left’ or ‘right’ etc. — 
i.e. they have to simulate the changing dynamic environment. They also 
have a second  example illustrating GPT -4V navigating the web . This time"
"GPT -4V can ‘click a mouse’, ‘scroll’, etc. Then, in a somewhat tentative and 
first attempt fashion, GPT -4V can navigate the web and find and order 
whatever you wish  (be it milk or whatever) ."
"154 There is no pretense here that this navigation, planning, and problem 
solving  is a fait accompli . However, this is an important first step in 
working with dynamic environments or sequences of images portraying 
dynamic environments."
"This has some relevance to librarianship. GPT -4V may well be able to 
navigate websites or the web to find information resources (even when 
those resources are not directly indexed or linked to).  
 
5.4 Yang et al. ’s Conclusion  on GPT -4V 
 
Yang et al. write:"
"In conclusion, OpenAI’s GPT -4Vision marks a monumental step 
towards harmonizing text and image understanding, paving the 
way for more intuitive and enriched interactions between humans 
and machines. As GPT -4V unfolds its potential, it not only"
"broadens the horizon for real -world applications but also beckons 
a future where AI can perceive and interpret the world in a 
manner akin to human cognition, thereby significantly driving 
forward the frontier of what is achievable in the realm of artificial 
intelligence  (Yang et al. 2023) ."
"Then, to paraphrase some of their other assertions on what the future 
might hold for developments of the OpenAI GPT series . GPT -4V adds 
vision to LMMs. It should be possible, in short order, to add video, audio, 
and other sensor data into the mix. Separately, most of the learning of the"
"LMMs thus far has come from text, principally self -supervision from vast 
amounts of text followed the reinforcement learning using humans. But it 
should be possible from LMMs to augment their base learning with"
"155 learning from modalities other than text. For example, to do some learning 
from real -world physical environments.  We are a year or so into the future 
from the Yang paper and Yang et al.  have been proved exactly right in their 
prognostications.  
 
5.5 GPT -4 Turbo  (Early 2024)"
"Early in 2024 , GPT -4 Turbo was the core component of the ChatGPT family  
(OpenAI Platform 2024) . GPT -4 Turbo:  
 
• has the visual capabilities of GPT -4V built in , 
• has the output capabilities of the image generator Dall -E 3 built"
"in. (We have not discussed image generators, but Dall -E 3 can 
produce images from text prompts.),  
• will accept text -to-speech requests. [The extent to which it can 
handle speech -to-text is unclear.  It cannot  conduct a dialog at 
the speed of ordinary speech ]"
"• is trained on information with a cut -off date of April 2023. So, 
its knowledge is more current  than earlier GPTs.  
• has a context window of about 128,000 tokens. That is about 
the equivalent of a book of 300 pages.  This allows for longer"
"input prompts. Having such a large context means that it can 
consider a reasonably sized book all at once (for example, for 
summarizing).  
• it is priced at 2 -3 times cheaper to run than earlier versions."
"156 5.6 GPT -4o (Later 2024)  
 
On 5/13/2024 OpenAI published the web page Hello GPT -4o : We’re 
announcing GPT -4o, our new flagship model that can reason across 
audio, vision, and text in real time  (OpenAI 2024) . 
 
GPT -4omni can  do all the tasks of earlier models, many with"
"improvements, but also it can work across the modalities in ‘real time’. This 
means, for example, that it can converse with a person at normal human 
speed. This makes a huge difference. Earlier OpenAI LLM based chatbots 
were slow in their responses. This made their conversation somewhat"
"unnatural, artificial, and tiring.  
 
5.7 Google’s Gemini  
 
On 12/6/2023 Google introduced Gemini, which is an LMM (Pichai and 
Hassabis 2023) . Sundar Pichai and Demis Hassabis assert:  
 
… [Gemini’s] performance exceeds current state -of-the-art results"
"on 30 of the 32 widely -used academic benchmarks used in large 
language model (LLM) research and development (Pichai and 
Hassabis 2023) . 
 
We are perfectly content to accept that this is true as of 12/6/2023. It 
means that Gemini was probably the best performing LLM or LMM at that"
"point. The caution needs to be added that there is strenuous competition in 
these areas so rankings may change through time. The situation here with 
Gemini is a little odd. Gemini is going to be released in 3 forms, but the best"
"157 version will not be available until 2024. Apparently, the comparisons with 
OpenAI’s GPT versions was with older versions, and, apparently, Google’s 
video extolling Gemini’s was selectively edited, polished, or ‘faked’. There is"
"a paper, 12/18/2023, by Syeda Nahida Akter  and fellow authors, An In -
depth Look at Gemini’s Language Abilities  which tests Gemini Pro (the 
middle level version) against various other LLMs (Akter et al. 2023) . It 
suggests that Gemini Pro is at about the level of GPT -3.5 Turbo (i.e. the"
"mid-level Gemini is a little off the pace).  
 
So, something good may be coming but we do not really know and it was 
not available moving into 2024.  
 
5.8 Anthropic’s Claude  
 
As of 7/7/2024, Anthropic’s most advanced multimodal LLM system is"
"Claude Sonnet 3.5 (Anthropic 2024) . Many commentators regard Sonnet 
3.5 as being the best LLM available, from any manufacturer. Such 
judgements are temporary and can change as new releases appear. Sonnet 
can do all the typical multimodal tasks, but faster and to a higher quality"
"that other models. [We will mention some benchmarks later.]  
 
One of the key features of Claude is its emphasis on ethical AI use and 
safety. Anthropic has embedded rigorous safety protocols and guidelines 
within Claude to mitigate potential risks associated with advanced AI"
"systems. This includes measures to prevent harmful outputs, ensure user 
privacy, and promote transparency in AI interactions. Claude's architecture 
and training regimen are designed to foster responsible AI behavior,"
"158 making it a reliable tool for users across various domains. By prioritizing 
safety and ethical considerations, Anthropic aims to set a new standard in 
the AI industry, ensuring that advancements like Claude contribute 
positively to society.  [This paragraph was w ritten by ChatGPT.]"
"5.9 Meta’s LLa Ma 
 
Meta's LLaMA  3 (Large Language Model Meta AI)  is a large language 
model in roughly the same category as the GPTs, Claudes and Geminis 
(Meta 2024) . It is not multimodal, nor is it multilingual (7/7/2024)."
"Although, those capabilities are under active development . Its performance 
is not to the standard of the over top -rank LLMs. It may be a year or so 
behind. However…  
 
A standout feature of LLaMA is its dedication to accessibility and"
"transparency. Meta has taken steps to ensure that LLaMA's capabilities are 
available to a broad audience, promoting an open research culture where 
insights and improvements can be shared widely. This approach is intended 
to foster collaboration and innovation within the AI community, driving"
"forward the collective understanding of AI and its applications. 
Additionally, Meta has prioritized the ethical deployment of LLaMA, 
embedding safety measures and guidelines to mitigate potential misuse and 
ensure responsible use. By focusing on both performance and ethical"
"considerations, Meta aims to establish LLaMA as a leading example of how 
large language models can be both powerful and principled.  (written by 
ChatGPT)."
"159 The LLaMA models are open -source and available to all  (through Hugging 
Face and other outlets) . 
 
5.10 Voice  
 
The use of voice was demonstrated with GPT -4o in May 2024  (but it has 
been slow to rollout  to Users) . It is reasonable to assume that the other"
"manufacture rs have something similar, and that real time voice interactions  
between Users and AI systems shortly will be available across all platforms. 
What is in prospect here are: 
 
• AI virtual counsellors, companions, and friends"
"• AI virtual assistants as exemplified in the 2013 film Her (Wikipedia 
2024)  
• Improved customer support and help  
• Etc. 
 
 
5.11 Possible Application s for LMMs  
 
5.11.1 Smartphone Uses  
 
GPT -4V can transcribe printed or handwritten text. (What the limits are"
"here are not entirely clear, but there certainly is reasonable success at this.) 
Having text in the 0s and 1s of computer processing is  valuable for many"
"160 uses  (as we emphasized in the Paean to this in Chapter 1) . This ability of 
GPT -4V can be used in tandem with camera of a smartphone. Then users 
will be able to carry the means of transcription in their purses or pockets.  
 
5.11.2 Spot the Difference"
"GPT -4V can spot the difference between two images. This means that in 
many settings it will be able to spot the defects in products of industrial 
manufacturing processes.  
5.11.3 Producing Reports from  Medical Images"
"GPT -4V can do this, although not perfectly. It  is not of the requisite quality 
at this time . The capabilities  of LMMs  here will improve, but, at present, 
their  role would be that of being intelligent assistant s to expert doctors and 
consultants.  
 
5.11.4 Assist with Image Generation"
"GPT -4V can consider the results of other image generation programs (Dall -
E, Stable Diffusion, etc.). In particular, it can consider the prompts and the 
relevant images and evaluate them. This might provide an evaluation model"
which can then be used for reinforcement learning  for the image generation
"161 programs  themselves . Also, it can simply make suggestions on how to 
improve the prompts.  It can rewrite the prompts.  
 
5.11.5 Extension with Plug ins 
 
It is sensible to hand of certain kinds of tasks to outside software or"
"‘plug ins’. For example, GPT -4V has training data covering a certain time -
period. It can be revised and updated, but it is not going to be given new 
training every day or every hour. A strategy here is to have a plugin that can"
"supply up to date news. A second example are payments or, more generally, 
services. Credit card companies can manage online payments. But these 
would not be built in  to a core version of GPT -4V, rather they would be a"
"way of extending the capabilities for certain purpose s. Plugins are a part of 
standard commercial LLM architecture. Presumably they would become a 
part of L MM architecture (and some  of the plugins  may be multi -modal).  
 
5.11.6 Retrieval -Augmented Generation (RAG )"
"There is a technique , Retrieval -Augmented Generation (RAG) , which is 
functionally somewhat similar  to plug -ins (Lewis et al. 2021; Gao et al. 
2023) . It is to  keep an LLM up to date with what it ‘knows’ and to be more"
"accurate in its replies. The idea is to give the LLM access to an external 
database or databases. Then factual prompt questions to the LLM are 
augmented with the instruction to check with the databases and find 
supporting facts, references, and citations. As external knowledge grows"
"162 there is no need to re -train the LLM. Rather, all that is required is for the 
databases to be updated (which they usually would be as a matter of course, 
say for news articles  and similar ). 
 
5.11.7 Label and Categorize Images"
"Adding metadata to images is a challenging problem for librarianship. GPT -
4V has the potential to be valuable here. There is value also for ordinary 
people being able to label, categorize, and sort , for example, the images on"
"their smartphones.  This latter task may in part conflict with the safety 
feature of not identifying people in images.  
 
5.11.8 Identify Objects  
 
This has many uses: from identifying plants and trees for gardeners , 
hobbyists,  or farmers through to military applications."
"5.11.9 ‘Igor’, AI Advantage and AI Community  
 
There are  more new use cases  for any one person to keep up  with the 
possibilities . My suggestion on how to learn about your focus of interest 
would be to look at the videos available on AI Advantage  and at the"
"materials in AI Community  (AI Advantage 2024; AICommunity 2024) . Igor 
is the prime mover of these."

many references. It is a research paper and probably not entirely suitable for us."
"164 Chapter 6: Evaluation and the Future  
 
6.1 Reliability , Trustworthiness,  and Alignment  
 
We all know what the word ‘reliable’ means in ordinary speech. There is the 
element of consistency to it and the element of trustworthiness. If an old"
"car is reliable, it needs to be able to do what cars typically do and 
potentially to be able to do that on more than one occasion.  
 
In the theory of research methods  in statistics , there are the concepts of 
reliability and validity. These are concepts that are applied to instruments"
"or observations. Reliability is consistency  under repeat trials . Validity is 
truth or veracity. Say a person weighs 180lbs and they regularly use some 
specific bathroom scales. If those scales indicate 182lbs on many  uses by"
"the person,  while the  person’s  weight is unchanged , the scales are reliable. 
Were the scales to have indicate d 30lbs on repeat trials , the scales would 
still reliable  even though the reading s are in the realm of fantasy . But if they"
"were to indicate 178lbs on one occasion and 182lbs on another, they would 
be unreliable. If the scales measured 180lbs, that measurement would be 
valid. If sometimes measurements produced two different values, at least 
one of those would have to be not valid. Two measurements that contradict"
"cannot both  be valid.  The gold standard is for an instrument to be reliable 
and to produce only values that were valid. Reliability, together with 
validity, are the aims.  Notice that there is little or no trust or 
trustworthiness in statistical reliability (apart from the trust that repeat"
trials produce the same result).
"165  
In machine learning , modern AI uses primarily concepts of reliability and 
alignment.  Generally, r esearchers in ML are experts on statistics and are 
familiar with statistical reliability. But in practice, in their writings, AI"
"reliability often has a similarity to common sense reliability i.e. 
repeatability plus trustworthiness.  
 
Predictions, or measurements, or outcomes, in AI are often used in settings 
where probability is involved. For example, completing the sentence ‘The"
"cat sat on the [Mask]’ might produce ‘The cat sat on the mat’ on one 
occasion and ‘The cat sat on the pillow’ on another. The outcomes are 
different. But this does not have to mean that the LLM in question is 
unreliable. There are probabilities associated with the next words of: ‘mat’,"
"‘pillow’, ‘blanket’, etc. For the LLM to be reliable  here , it needs to do the 
completions in line with the probabilities. Not all outcomes from LLMs 
involve probabilities, but many do. In general, assessing reliability in the 
context of AI is tricky."
"Alignment is that a model's predictions or behavior correspond closely with 
the expected or desired or intended outcome.  This can be similar to validity 
in statistical research methods, but it can be different also. Validity focusses"
"on truth. But, for example, writing poetry, as an LLM might  do, does not 
have much use for truth. Elsewhere, t here are  questions of safety, bias, and 
offensive language. Generally, we would not always want LLMs offering"
"perhaps correct medical advice, nor producing perhaps correct recipes for 
constructing bombs, nor telling people , perhaps truly,  that they are ‘fat’.  
Getting AI systems to do what we would like is alignment."
"166  
6.2 System 1 and System 2  
 
In 2011 , the behavioral scientist  Daniel Kahneman  published  Thinking, 
Fast and Slow  (Kahneman 2011) . In it , the distinction is made between 
System 1 thinking  and System 2 thinking. System 1 thinking is fast,"
"intuitive, near automatic, and requires little effort.  System 2 thinking  is 
slower , more logical  and usual ly requires attention and deliberation . 
Catching a ball lobbed gently from a few yards  away  uses System 1. In"
"contrast, a  grandmaster’s move in the middle of a chess game uses System 
2. (See also, (Loo 2024) .) 
 
There is an analogy and speculation that can be used here in connection 
with LLMs. LLMs typically do next word prediction, or, more generally,"
"next token prediction. They have been trained on a vast amount of data, 
sometimes close to the entire Internet. In effect, they have skimmed a lot of 
books then take a prompt and return the next word (and the word after"
"that, etc.). From an analogical point of view, this is System 1 thinking . At 
this point  of development,  we could probably concede that LLMs can match 
humans on System 1 tasks.  
 
What about System 2? What about logical reasoning with deliberation? Of"
"course, computers can play chess, and similar, better than any humans. But 
chess playing computers do not use large language models. They essentially 
brute force the problems, which is a different approach.  [The Zhores 
supercomputer used by Nepomniachtchi in training for his 2021 world title"
"chess match, can evaluate tens of millions of chess positions per second."
"167 Basically, it overwhelms the problem with computation and data. ] Existing 
benchmarks on LLMs  suggest that at they are weak on reasoning . It may be 
that LLMs on their own will always struggle on System 2 tasks.  
 
6.3 Benchmarks  
6.3.1 Introduction"
"One way of getting an understanding of what LMMs can do is by looking at 
common benchmarks. Talking casually, the moment an LMM displays an 
ability researchers will produce a benchmark to measure that ability. One 
motivation the researchers have here is to compare the performance of an"
"LMM either against earlier versions of itself or against rival L MMs. For our 
purposes, we are not such much interested in the results under the 
benchmarks as we are in the benchmarks themselves — the abilities that the 
benchmarks are supposedly testing for."
"Benchmarks can have drawbacks. For example, the LLMs can be trained 
with one eye on the benchmarks (‘training to the test’). Also, some of the 
data, patterns or techniques shown in the tests can bleed back into an LLM 
(for example, by being  used in the training)."
"6.3.2 Multi -turn dialogs  
That is, the user gives a prompt, the LMM replies, then user then gives 
another prompt (in the context of the earlier prompt and reply), and so on."
"168 MT-Bench is an example  of testing for this : 
 
MT-bench is designed to test multi -turn conversation and 
instruction -following ability, covering common use cases and 
focusing on challenging questions to differentiate models. We 
identify 8 common categories of user prompts to guide its"
"construction:  
 
• writing,  
• roleplay,  
• extraction,  
• reasoning,  
• math,  
• coding,   
• knowledge I (STEM),  
• and knowledge II (humanities/social science)  
 
(Zheng et al. 2023)  
 
6.3.3 Chatbot s 
One possibility  of a benchmark  here is Chatbot Arena  (Chiang et al. 2024) ."
"This allows users to run two rival chatbots side -by-side, compare the 
results, and vote on the outcomes. The benchmark  does not so much  tell 
you what the chatbots can do, as reveal human preferences. But, to an 
extent, the preferences are a measure of how well the chatbots do what the"
"users would like, or expect, them to do. So, in some perhaps weak sense, the 
benchmark measures alignment.  
6.3.4 Reasoning  
There is the A12 Reasoning Challenge (A12 Allen Institute for AI 2022) :"
"169  
The ARC dataset contains 7,787 genuine grade -school level, 
multiple -choice science questions, assembled to encourage 
research in advanced question -answering …. 
 
…in particular questions  that require reasoning, use of 
commonsense knowledge, and other methods for deeper text"
"comprehension …. those that are hard to answer with simple 
baselines.  
 
Example  ARC  Question  
Which property of a mineral can be determined just by looking at 
it? 
o luster  
o mass  
o weight  
o hardness  
 
6.3.4 Comm on sense reasoning"
"Another  popular benchmark for common sense reasoning is HellaSwag  
(Zellers et al. 2019) .  Its  dataset presents multiple -choice questions where 
models must choose the most plausible continuation or outcome of a given"
"situation described in text. This requires models to infer logical conclusions 
from the context provided.  Here is an example.  
 
Context:  A person is standing in a kitchen with a cutting board 
and a knife. They pick up an apple and begin to...  
Options:"
"A. ...throw it across the room to their friend who 
catches it.  
B. ...cut it into slices to make a fruit salad.  
C. ...put it in their pocket and leave the kitchen.  
D. ...start peeling it with a vegetable peeler."
"170 Answer:  B. ...cut it into slices to make a fruit salad.  This is the 
most plausible continuation given the context.  
 
 
HellaSwag’s  dataset has been developed since its original proposal in 2019.  
 
6.3.5 MMLU  
 
The MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) benchmark is"
"designed to evaluate the multitask accuracy of large language models across 
a wide range of subjects and tasks. It includes questions from 57 different 
subjects, spanning areas such as humanities, social sciences, STEM, and 
more. The benchmark tests models' ability to understand and generate"
"accurate responses across various domains, reflecting their general 
knowledge and reasoning capabilities.  The structure of the MMLU 
benchmark typically involves multiple -choice questions, with each subject 
having its own set of questions. These questions are often at the level of"
"difficulty encountered in real -world exams or standardized tests.  
An devised example of an MMLU question might look like this:  
 
Subject: History  
Question: Who was the first President of the United States?  
Options:  
A. Abraham Lincoln  
B. Thomas Jefferson  
C.  George Washington"
"D. John Adams  
Answer: C. George Washington"
"171 The goal is to assess the model's breadth and depth of knowledge across 
many different subjects and its ability to apply this knowledge effectively.  
 
6.3.6 Coding  
Executive summary: some LLMs are extremely good at writing computer 
code."
"code.  
 
Several benchmarks are widely used for evaluating the coding capabilities 
of large language models. These benchmarks assess various aspects of 
programming skills, including code generation, bug fixing, and code 
completion. Some of the most notable benchmarks include:  
1. CodeXGLUE :"
"o Description : A comprehensive benchmark and collection of 
datasets for code -related tasks, including code generation, code 
completion, code summarization, and more.  
o Tasks : Code -to-code tasks, text -to-code tasks, code -to-text 
tasks, etc.  
2. HumanEval :"
"o Description : A benchmark specifically designed to evaluate 
the functional correctness of generated code by using unit tests.  
o Tasks : Given a natural language prompt, the model must 
generate a correct and functional code snippet that passes the 
provided unit tests."
3. APPS (Automated Programming Progress Standard) :
"172 o Description : A benchmark that includes a diverse set of 
coding problems, ranging from introductory to complex 
algorithmic challenges.  
o Tasks : The model must write code to solve given programming 
problems, and solutions are evaluated based on correctness and 
efficiency."
"4. MBPP (Mostly Basic Programming Problems) : 
o Description : A dataset of basic programming problems 
designed to evaluate the model's ability to generate correct and 
executable code.  
o Tasks : Code generation based on problem statements, with"
"evaluations focusing on correctness and simplicity.  
5. CodeBERT : 
o Description : A pre -trained model for programming 
languages, evaluated on a variety of coding tasks.  
o Tasks : Includes tasks like code search, code documentation 
generation, and code completion."
"6. XLCoST (eXtreme Language Code Search and Translation) : 
o Description : A benchmark for code search and code 
translation across multiple programming languages.  
o Tasks : Code search, where the model retrieves relevant code 
snippets based on natural language queries, and code"
"translation, where the model translates code from one 
programming language to another.  
These benchmarks provide a robust framework for evaluating the 
performance of language models in coding tasks, helping researchers and"
"173 developers understand the strengths and weaknesses of their models in 
real-world programming scenarios.  [This section was written by an LLM.]  
 
6.4 Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)  
 
There is the idea of Artificial General Intelligence, which roughly amounts"
"to simultaneously being more intelligent than a human at all intelligent 
endeavors. Quite what this notion is exactly  has never been tightly pinned 
down. Supposedly OpenAI have an internal 5 -level scale to track progress 
towards AGI. It is:"
"1. Conversation to the standard of present day chatbots  
2. Solving problems to the level of a person with a PhD.  
3. Being  capable of taking actions on a user’s behalf.  
4. Creating new innovations.  
5. Perform ing the work of entire organizations of people ."
"Present LLMs can do 1, and nearly do 2, but are yet to reach the other three 
levels  (Metz 2024) . There have been other  suggestions on AGI. We will 
follow one of them, that from François Chollet (Chollet 2019; ARCPrize 
2024) ."
"Chollet invites us to consider intelligent tasks, as examples playing chess, 
summarizing a document, and solving a High School math problem. We 
know from current LLMs and their benchmarks that v ery likely AI systems"
"will be able to do all such tasks far better, far more ‘intelligently ’, than a 
human. Would this mean that AGI had been created? Chollet answers No."
"174 Chollet observes that designers of a program to play chess know exactly 
what the problem is. Similarly , creators of AI systems to summarize 
documents  know what is to be done. He suggests:  
 
Measuring task -specific skill is not a good proxy for intelligence …."
"Intelligence lies in broad or general -purpose abilities; it is marked 
by skill -acquisition  and generalization, rather than skill itself.  
AGI is a system that can efficiently acquire  new  skills 
outside of its training data …. 
This means that a system is able to adapt to a new environment"
"that it has not seen before and that its creators (developers) did 
not anticipate.  (ARCPrize 2024) . 
 
Chollet suggests that the way LLMs work is that they are large ‘interpolative 
memories’. They have seen, and remembered, a vast quantity of facts, data,"
"and patterns — all of the Internet, basically. Then they retrieve or fill in the 
gaps, to produce their answers  from prompts . But, Chollet observes, human 
intelligence is of a more general kind.  The world is always changing."
"Humankind has need not only to deal with the familiar, but also to confront 
the totally novel. E ven a five -year -old can solve problems both that they 
have never seen before and of a kind  that they have never seen before. 
Seemingly LLMs cannot do this."
"Chollet has designed an ‘IQ test for Artificial General Intelligence’. Five year 
olds can do it  to a level of 50%,  unexceptional adults can score about 85% 
on it, and , mid -2024,  the best LLMs might get around 10%  (Patel 2024) ."
"175 6.5 The ARC -AGI Benchmark  
 
Chollet asserts that ARC -AGI is the only current AI benchmark that 
measures progress towards general intelligence.  
 
The benchmark  is a whole suite of tests. They are designed to be resistant to"
"prior memorization. Earlier tests won’t help you. Nor will study of any 
matters whatsoever. Here is a sample. You are given three examples of 
inputs and their corresponding outputs . Then there is a test input for which"
"you must  suggest the output. Try it. (No prizes for success — you should be 
able to do it.  Many five -year -olds can. ) 
 
 
 
Figure 17. Sample ARC -AGI test"
"176  
As mentioned, humans would score about 80% on the entire benchmark . 
LLMs might get 10% or so. Chollet and Mike Knoop have offered a  
substantial monetary prize  to any AI system that can score 85% i.e. that is 
be better than humans (Patel 2024) ."
"Mid-2024, it looks as though the ARC challenge poses a real difficulty for 
LLMs. It is, of course, possible for LLMs to improve. It is also possible for 
some AI or machine learning system which uses different principles or"
"techniques  from LLM s to succeed with th e ARC test . What the test is 
looking for is a system that can adapt to a task that  is truly novel from the 
perspective of its training data (Patel 2024) . 
   
6.6 Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)"
"There is the notion of the ‘singularity’, which was introduced by Ray 
Kurtzweil (Kurzweil 2005) . The idea here is that as technology advances 
there will come a point when it becomes smarter than we are . At that point, 
the ‘singularity’, the machines can simply design themselves and become"
"smarter and smarter in a runaway fashion. There is the similar idea in AI 
and that is Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) . If indeed Artificial General 
Intelligence (AGI) is possible, then, presumably these intelligent systems"
"can simply design even better machines — better systems than humans can 
design, and better systems than they themselves are. The result would be 
Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) . More than a few ‘futurists’ are very 
concerned about the possibility of ASI. An ASI system would have no need"
"for humans, and hence might be a threat to humans. Further, any"
"177 individual, group, or country that  was the sole possessor of ASI would , or 
might,  have unlimited power and control over everyone else.  
 
A detailed argument to that effect is provided by Leopold Aschenbrenner in 
his 160 page book  Situational  Awareness : The Decade Ahead"
"(Aschenbrenner 2024) . This might be summarized  as follows (with brief 
annotations) : 
 
• There will be AGI  by about 2027.  [Anschenbrenner gets this by 
extrapolation from current rates of progress. But, for example, if 
System 2 thinking proves a barrier, i.e. the ARC -AGI consideration,"
"this reasoning might not be sound.]  
• There will be ASI about a year later.  [This comes from  the suggestion 
to creat e thousands of AGI bots and throwing them at every unsolved 
scientific, mathematical, and other problem. But, so -to-speak, having"
"a thousand ‘Einsteins’ might not get us any further than having just 
one of them  (cf. The Mythical Man -Month  (Brooks 1975) .] 
• ASI might convey a decisive military and political advantage to 
whoever has it first. The ‘might’ here mainly concerns alignment, or"
"‘superalignment’. ASI is of advantage to its owner or creators only if 
ASI instances do what the owners want them to.  If ASI instances 
‘have minds of their own’ and do whatever they wish, that may  make 
them useless, or even dangerous, to their owners.  [But this alignment"
"problem is highly non -trivial  because the systems are so large and 
complex that humans, or RLHF, simply cannot understand what is 
going on. Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) just 
will not work. There will need to be another way. ]"
"178 • What characterizes these deep learning, LLM, or even ASI, systems 
are the weights  they use in their models . Weights are  just numbers. 
There may be many of them, billions, or trillions, but they are still just 
number s. If an adversary can steal the numbers , they can create the"
"systems without bothering to do the research . [True, with evidence.]  
• Bad actors at the state level (say, Russia, China, Iran, or North Korea) 
likely could steal the weights from any ordinary commercial 
enterprise without much difficulty.  Thus, there is a serious security"
"problem.  [Probably True, and there is evidence (Stuxnet ’s sabotage of 
Iran’s nuclear centrifuges  and, separately,  Pegasus spyware against 
smartphones.)]

"179 Chapter 7: Bias  and Unfairness  
 
7.1 Algorithmic Pipeline + Data = Machine Learning  
 
Niklaus Wirth's 1976 book Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs  is 
one the most important and influential books in computer science. It led to"
"the style of structured programming, the development of the Pascal 
programming language, the move toward typed programming languages, 
and the design of many University programming courses.  
 
Somehow, nowadays, the whiff of the title has found its way into modern"
"characterizations of ML. Many say that Algorithms  + Data  = Machine 
Learning . Then reasoning proceeds from the premise 'There is (plenty of) 
bias in Machine Learning' to 'There is bias in ML Algorithms and there is 
bias in ML Data.' This is not quite right, though. It is not right on the"
"location of bias (and locating the bias correctly will help us to address it). 
When a computer program is written there is the question of what the 
prog ram is supposed to do. Is it supposed to add up some numbers? Is it 
supposed to find the address of someone in a Contacts book? Is it supposed"
"to suggest folk qualified for a mortgage on the basis of demographic 
information about them? This what -it-is-supposed -to-do part is usually 
called the specification . What a specification amounts to varies with 
circumstance. A hobbyist programmer may have a rough mental idea of"
"what she is trying — that may be a specification without anything being 
written down. In con trast, a specification for a program, or project, like 
Google Documents may consist of hundreds of pages of text written in a"
"180 very formal style. Specifications can change as projects develop and are in 
process (for example, to omit features that prove to be difficult to 
implement). But changing specifications is considered bad form, and it is 
usually avoided if possible."
"Imagine this as an example of some biased software. A mortgage company 
gives their expert programming team the task of producing some mortgage 
qualifying software with a partial specification that only black applicants 
should qualify. The programmers, expert as they are, then produce a"
"flawless program to do exactly this. The outcome may be biased. Let us 
suppose that it is. Where does the bias come from? It may come from the 
data. But suppose that the data, its veridicality, its sampling, etc., is perfect 
in every way. So, the bias has not come from the data. What about the"
"algorithms in the program? Well, it could easily be that they are entirely 
perfect in every way. So, there is no bias there either. What is left? The bias 
comes from the specification.  
 
A formal specification is only part of the programming infrastructure"
"surrounding projects (especially so in large organizations, businesses, or 
institutions). ML projects are mostly complex. There often is development 
and deployment. There is an entire pipeline, a programming 'environment'. 
Bias can arise anywhere in this, or, indeed in several different places."
"Johanna Johansen et al. suggest the label 'programming artifacts' for this 
infrastructure (Johansen, Pedersen, and Johansen 2021) . This is a good 
idea. However, many ML researchers and programmers tend to use a 
flowing water metaphor to capture the process. They talk of 'downstream',"
"181 'upstream', and 'pipeline', and other similar descriptive  nouns . We will do 
the same.  
 
Algorithmic  Pipeline  + Data = Machine Learning .  
 
Bias in Machine Learning comes from bias in the Algorithmic Pipeline or 
bias in the Data."
"Some commentators allow the location of bias to spread beyond the 
individual algorithmic pipelines to the AI industry as a whole (for example, 
that there is a preponderance of male employees, that much of it is funded"
"by the state and the military, that it is commercial aiming to make a profit).  
(See, for example, (de Hond, van Buchem, and Hernandez -Boussard 
2022) .) 
 
7.2 Some Clarification of the Term s 'Bias'  and 
‘Unfairness’"
"There is a need for care when using the terms ‘bias’ and ‘unfairness’ in the 
context of machine learning. Most educated adults know what these words 
mean in the sense of being able to produce illustrative  sentences that use"
"these words correctly and being able to paraphrase the  sentences  of others  
that use the words. In machine learning , some of the literature use s these 
two words interchangeable as synonyms  (Pagano et al. 2023) . This is not"
"correct in general, though. The word ‘bias’, or the phrase ‘predictive bias’ , 
have  extensive use s in statistics and machine learning t o mean ‘error’ or 
‘systematic error’. But many of these errors are not either fair or unfair."
"182 Imagine an ML program to predict the weather and suppose the weather 
could be only either sunny or rainy. Suppose the model’s daily predictions 
were sometimes correct and sometimes mistaken . (That might be the best"
"one could hope for. ) But if the model predicted 100 days of rain in the year 
and actually there were 300 observed days of rain that year, the model has 
predictive bias. This kind of bias has nothing to do with unfairness to"
"anything or anybody. It is not unfair to rainy days. ML researchers would 
like rid of this kind of predictive bias from their model. But this is not an 
ethical mandate. It is not a matter of justice. The researchers just want their"
"models to be more accurate. Here is a second example. LLMs predict the 
next letter, token, or word from a context or prompt. Imagine that GPT -
0.01, working in English, never predicted the letter ‘e’  as being the next 
letter . GPT -0.01 would have predictive bias. But its predictions are not"
"unfair. (Although, the children’s television program Sesame Street might 
say they are unfair to the letter ‘e’.)  There are also harms that can result 
from the predictions of machine learning programs. But there can be harms"
"without bias (where there are no errors  in the program and its predictions ) 
and harms without unfairness (where every person or group is harmed 
equally).  
 
Tiago Pagano and fellow authors write:  
 
Prediction -based decision algorithms are being widely adopted by"
"governments and organizations, and are already commonly used 
in lending, contracting, and online advertising, as well as in 
criminal pre -trial proceedings, immigration detention, and public 
health, among other areas.  
However, as these techniques gained popularity, concerns arose"
about the bias embedded in the models and how fair they are in
"183 defining their performance for issues related to sensitive social 
aspects such as race, gender, class, and so on.  
Systems that have an impact on people’s lives raise ethical 
concerns about making fair and unbiased judgments. As a result,"
"challenges to bias and unfairness have been thoroughly studied, 
taking into consideration the constraints imposed by corporate 
practices, legislation, societal traditions, and ethical 
commitments. Recognizing and reducing bias and unfairness are"
"tough undertakings because unfairness differs between cultures. 
As a consequence, the unfairness criteria are influenced by user 
experience, cultural, social, historical, political, legal, and ethical 
factors  (Pagano et al. 2023) ."
"Bias is a huge archipelago of topics. The word 'bias' has several totally 
different meanings.  
 
In the ML technical core, there is bias in the context of the weighting of 
inputs to software neurons in neural nets. Then, in wider ML, Aylin"
"Caliskan et al. define bias with the following statement : 
 
In AI and machine learning, bias refers generally to prior 
information, a necessary prerequisite for intelligent action.  Yet 
bias can be problematic where such information is derived from"
"aspects of human culture known to lead to harmful behavior. 
Here, we will call such biases “stereotyped” and actions taken on 
their basis “prejudiced.” (Caliskan, Bryson, and Narayanan 2017)  
[Italics added.]  
 
This is important. It is completely standard in the context of machine"
"learning. However, i t is completely non -standard, and totally at odds with 
what ordinary people might mean by bias in ordinary settings. Generally, 
bias is not a good thing, and we would like rid of it. It is to be spurned. But,"
"'information' can mean 'knowledge' (Frické 1997) . So, in a ML program, any"
"184 part of the entirety of human knowledge might be 'bias'. For example, that 
2 + 2 = 4 might be bias.  
 
Machine learning researchers also often use the term ‘bias’ in connection 
with the predictions of a model. More specifically, they might use the"
"phrase  ‘predictive bias’ in this setting. Many ML models make predictions. 
Then, of course, the question arises of whether the predictions are  correct 
or incorrect. If they are incorrect, especially incorrect in a systematic way, 
the model would be said to exhibit ‘predictive bias’."
"Separately, also related to ML — with causal diagrams, and the statistics of 
causality, there is the central notion of confounds. These are often called 
'bias'.  
 
In chance like set -ups, typically for gambling, such as roulette wheels,"
"rolled dice, or tossed coins, the set -up is unfair or biased if the chances are 
not as they should be. If a thrown coin favors Heads over Tails, it is biased.  
 
In the context of people and diversity , there is the notion of bias meaning"
"'unfair prejudice'. For example, The Office of Diversity and Outreach of the 
University of California San Francisco  offers this description of bias in a 
general non -computing setting:  
 
Bias  is a prejudice in favor of or against one thing, person, or"
"group compared with another usually in a way that's considered to 
be unfair. Biases may be held by an individual, group, or 
institution and can have negative or positive consequences. There 
are types of biases 1.  Conscious bias  (…explicit  bias) and 
2. Unconscious  bias ( … implicit  bias)"
"185 … biases, conscious or unconscious, are not limited to ethnicity 
and race. … biases may exist toward any social group. One's age, 
gender, gender identity physical abilities, religion, sexual 
orientation, weight, and many other characteristics are subject to"
"bias.  (UCSF Office of Diversity and Outreach UCSF 2022)  
 
[Of value as background here on this sense of bias are Project Implicit, the 
Implicit Association Test (IAT) and the work of the Kirwan Institute 
(“Project Implicit” 2011; Kirwan Institute 2017) .]"
"Then there are cognitive biases. One example is confirmation bias. This is 
the tendency, w ith beliefs or knowledge, for people to seek out, or give more 
weight to, evidence or arguments that support or ‘confirm’ views or"
"opinions that they already hold (Wikipedia 2023b) . Another example  of a 
cognitive bias  is that  actual human reasoning, both the principles used and 
the individual instances of it, is often incorrect, maybe even almost always"
"incorrect (A. Tversky 1974; Kahneman 2011) . One famous instance of this  is 
the base -rate fallacy embodied in the so -called Harvard Medical School test 
((Casscells, Schoenberger, and Graboys 1978)  see also Appendix C). 
 
Further, the conceptual schemes and natural languages that are in use"
"reflect all sorts of attitudes, and attributions of accidental features that do 
not really belong in an accurate description of what they are applied to. 
There is bias in conceptual schemes and language.  Unfortunately, more"
"than a little ML, especially unsupervised, or self -supervised, learning (i.e. 
finding patterns and clusters where there are no sample right answers), 
builds off the Natural Language Processing (NLP) of books, recordings, 
language, and conceptual schemes. NLP needs a section to itself (which we"
will get to).

7.3 Forms of Bias in Wider Machine Learning  
 
Kate Crawford, in her 2017 keynote address to the Neural Information 
Processing Systems  Conference, identifies three main forms of bias in the 
context of ML: harms of allocation, harms of representation, and harms of"
"classification (Crawford 2017; Barocas et al. 2017) . The first concerns who 
does or does not get the mortgages, or who does or does not get shorter 
prison sentences when re -offending, etc. i.e. fairness of allocation. The 
second concerns how individuals, groups, or even things and classes of"
"things, are represented or portrayed or named.  [This involves emotive 
content, which is a topic introduced in Appendix A .] Of course, being 
represented in a negative way may have consequences, for example, that of 
not being allocated a mortgage. The third concerns how humans, individual"
"human beings or groups of human beings, are watched, perhaps surveilled, 
and classified, usually for other, often discriminatory, purposes, for 
example, for apartheid as it was in South Africa (Bowker and Star 2000; 
Gandy Jr. 2021; Crawford 2022) . (An allusion here is to the Panopticon  of"
"Jeremy Bentham and his brother, Samuel Bentham, (cf. Foucault's 
panoptic prison  (Brunon -Ernst 2012) )).  We should note that this kind of 
classification is different to the classification done by librarians. Librarians 
classify recorded documents and information resources (e.g. books), not"
"human beings.  
 
As noted, bias is a vast territory. Even within ML it is possible to expand 
Crawford's classification of three biases out to seven or more biases (see, for"
"187 example, (Suresh and Guttag 2021) ). Also of note, Su Lin Blodgett et al. 
critically surveyed 146 papers on bias in NLP  and found that : 
 
…the majority of them fail to engage critically with what 
constitutes “bias” in the f irst place (Blodgett et al. 2020)"
"The Blodgett et al. paper does have valuable suggestions. In part, first, that 
harms of allocation, and harms of representation will take you a long way 
when considering bias. Then : 
 
… work analyzing “bias” in NLP systems should provide explicit"
"statements of why the system behaviors that are described as 
“bias” are harmful, in what ways, and to whom  [further text 
omitted here].  (Blodgett et al. 2020)  
 
[Bommasani  et al. is another important source on the topic of bias in ML 
(Bommasani et al. 2022)  ]"
"For our purposes, and as a practicality, we can restrict ourselves going 
forward primarily to fairness, representation, and classification (primarily 
in the librarian's sense of 'classification').  
 
 
7.4 Bias in Natural Language Processing"
"Recently, say since about 2017 -2018, NLP has become a huge and 
significant part of ML. This is because of the emergence of Large Language 
Models and Foundation Models (which are being  discussed in more detail 
elsewhere ). These models form the core of many of the truly innovative"
"188 modern systems (hence 'Foundation Models'). In turn, they are based on 
natural language processing (NLP). So, NLP has become more important 
than ever, and biases in NLP can leak into the modern innovations.  
 
A well -known and introductory example of apparent bias in NLP concerns"
"the translation of Turkish. Turkish does not have gender pronouns, so 
translating into Turkish can lose the gender of the original. Then 
translating back may use 'gender bias' to make a guess as to the gender of 
the pronoun. A few years ago, you used to be able to do this on Google 
Translate :"
Figure 18. Translating from English to Turkish .
"189  
 
Figure 19. Translating the translation back from Turkish to 
English . 
 
There are a few points to be made. A human translator would make the 
same 'mistake'. There is no context in the brief Turkish text to pick up the"
"gender of the doctor and nurse in question. Given a longer text, say a 
magazine article or a novel, both the human translator and the ML 
translator would get this right. Separately, nowadays, as you can see from 
the screen shot, Google translate alerts the User to the gender -specific"
"alternatives. Finally, it is not entirely clear that this kind of example is a 
case of bias. There are more male doctors than female doctors, presumably 
more male Turkish doctors than female Turkish doctors. There is a higher"
"probability of a doctor being male than being female. We may find that fact 
unfortunate, and not good for society, for women, for medicine, and for the 
good life in general. But it is a fact. Consequently, if presented with those"
"probabilities and a remote doctor, of unknown male or female gender, 
unbiased reasoning would suggest the conjecture that the doctor was male."
"190 (In the absence of other information, you should choose the base -rate as 
your probability.  [There is more on the base -rate in Appendix C.]) 
 
Research, for example that of Aylin Caliskan et.al., has shown that everyday"
"languages have biases built in, and those biases can seep into the results of 
ML (Caliskan, Bryson, and Narayanan 2017; Caliskan 2021) . Aylin Caliskan 
et.al. write  
 
Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and"
"accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral 
as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or 
gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo 
distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. Our"
"methods hold promise for identifying and addressing sources of 
bias in culture, including technology  (Caliskan, Bryson, and 
Narayanan 2017) . 
 
The biases already exist in ordinary languages. ML did not create these"
"biases ; it just identifies them. Notice here the distinction they make in the 
second and third categories between the problematic and the veridical. This 
can be illustrated with the Turkish doctor case. It seems that, as a matter of"
"fact, ordinary everyday English, in English societies and cultures, has the 
status quo bias that doctors are male (that is why the example translation 
from Turkish goes wrong). Separate from this is the ques tion of whether 
this bias is problematic — whether we should  assume that doctors are"
"male — and probably most people would say that we should not assume 
this. Now, there is here a gulf between facts and values, between what 
biases do exist (the veridical) and what biases should not  exist (the 
problematic). Once values enter there are further problems. What is the"
"reasoning, the evidence, and the motivations for decisions on values? Who"
"191 decides? And on what basis? Then, if a view can be formed, how could it be 
implemented, either in natural language or in ML software? Some moral 
positions can have the backing of the law — murder is both wrong and 
illegal. But we presumably would not want to invoke the law against the"
"bias that doctors are male. In brief, there are many problems. To continue. 
These biases are in natural languages, and we are immersed in these 
languages. Likely there is some two -way traffic between the languages we 
use and th e biases we have. Our linguistic practices do change over time —"
"we, in English speaking America, are no longer comfortable with phrases 
like 'yellow peril' or words like 'ni **er'. That our linguistic biases have 
changed does not mean that shortly we will be free of all linguistic bias."
"Some fear that ML will amplify or entrench the existing biases in natural 
languages. It is hard to know. One factor that is awkward here is that much 
of NLP ML is unsupervised  or self -supervised . That means that the 
programs are often not being told the 'right' answers. The language corpora"
"that they work on are almost always huge. The GPT -x series, for example, 
essentially scan the entire Internet, maybe trillions of word tokens. If a 
program is looking for patterns, undirected, through the whole of the"
"Internet, it is hard to see how it could omit biases from that search (it does 
not even 'know' that they are biases). (GPT -3 itself, for example, can be 
given prompts, which can give it some direction. Prompts can tell it to be"
"safe and not to be toxic or biased.) Some biases can be reduced or removed 
in ML software on a piecemeal basis. There are de -biasing initiatives (e.g. 
(Bolukbasi et al. 2016)  ). We should take into account here considerations"
"of offensive speech, hate speech, and legal protections of free speech (such 
as the First Amendment in the United States). Google, and similar large 
outlets of speech, have policies and guidelines on being parties to the"
"192 publication of hate or offensive speech. Basically, the policies respect the 
laws while keeping themselves clear of what might be marginal cases. The 
biases that occur everywhere in everyday language would not be front and"
"center. Some tentative conclusions are… ML needs to use NLP to produce 
translations, sound interfaces, verbal assistants, and so forth. These 
technological possibilities are, on balance, so valuable that it is hard to 
imagine not pursuing them. Then data from NLP will likely contain bias,"
"and that bias will be hard to address.  
 
7.5 Some Clarification of the Term 'Algorithm'  
 
Presumably, some ML programs are biased (just being open minded here 
on what the word 'bias' might mean in this context). But we need to be"
"measured in addressing a serious issue. Here is what some prominent 
commentators write : 
 
Algorithms are neither neutral nor objective. They are 
programmed by human beings, who have both conscious and 
unconscious biases, and those biases are encoded into software  
(Cordell 2020) ."
"… essentially a lie — namely, that algorithms were being presented 
and marketed as objective fact. A much more accurate description 
of an algorithm is that it's an opinion embedded in math (O’Neil 
2018) . 
 
… algorithms are the result of human endeavor and human -"
"generated data sets so they are just as biased as we are . We just 
can't see it.  
As humans, we all have implicit biases. And as we build these new 
systems – facial recognition, AI, analytical algorithms – we’re"
"193 creating them in our own image, with these biases baked in. (Ayre 
and Craner 2018) .  
 
… algorithms are the product of explicit and latent biases held by 
humans  (Padilla 2019) .  
 
The sentiments expressed here are both factually wrong and pernicious."
"The Ryan Cordell passage, to take one example, is from a report for the 
Library of Congress, which is the most important institutional body in 
American librarianship. The Library of Congress here thus presumably 
approves of, and certainly promulgates, a report that misleads librarians."
"Most algorithms, computer science algorithms and folklore 'algorithms', are 
not biased . [See Section 1. 7. For example, the algorithm division by 
successive subtraction is not biased, period.]  Separately, the argument 'All 
humans are biased, therefore, all human products (e.g. software) are"
"biased' is invalid and has a false premise. Some more detail, or evidence, 
can be added here. The US federal agency IMLS (Institute of Museum and 
Library Services) has funded a useful and informative educational resource 
on algorithmic awareness, aimed to an audience of information"
"professionals (Clark [2018] 2022) . The resource mentions, and 
demonstrates, the following as important algorithms, used in online search : 
 
… PageRank, merge sort and heap sort, Dijkstra’s algorithm, link 
analysis, and TF -IDF (Term Frequency -Inverse Document"
"Frequency) (Clark [2018] 2022) . 
 
None of these algorithms is biased. Take Dijkstra’s algorithm,  for example. 
As an analog of what it does: it will find the shortest path, or route, between"
"194 any two cities, where there are several cities connected by roads (sometimes 
a direct route is shortest, sometimes going via intermediary cities is the 
shortest). This algorithm is not biased (in any sense of 'bias' whatsoever)."
"Here is a general argument to refute the view that all algorithms are biased: 
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm, Dijkstra's algorithm is not biased, 
ergo , not all algorithms are biased.  
 
We do not wish to get tied up here with arguing the meaning of words. If"
"those concerned with shortcomings with the use of computers in society 
regularly talk about 'algorithmic bias', the 'social power of algorithms', or 
even '#FuckTheAlgorithm', that is fine (Beer 2017; Benjamin 2022) . We 
will open our minds to this. For ourselves, we prefer 'bias in the"
"programming artifacts', or 'bias in the algorithmic pipeline' or just the plain 
'bias in the software'. We will cautiously and tentatively use this, and 
similar phrasing, in the case of ML algorithms. What we will not do is buy"
"into the argument 'we are all biased, therefore all our algorithms and 
computer software are biased'.  
 
7.6 Computer Program Inadequacy  
 
Some computer programs are unreliable. That will not come as news to 
you. Some unreliable computer programs are used in circumstances where"
"their output, advice, or decisions have serious human or material 
consequences. A regularly cited example is risk assessment in the criminal 
justice system (Tashea 2017; Angwin and Larson 2016; Budds, Budds, and 
Budds 2017) . In some jurisdictions software is used to predict whether"
convicted felons are at risk of offending again. This kind of software can
"195 make false positive errors in classification (that a felon is at risk of 
reoffending, when the felon actually is not) and false negative errors (that a 
felon is not at risk of reoffending, when the felon actually is). (See Appendix"
"C.1 for further explanation of false positives and false negatives.) Certainly, 
some examples of this software seem to be very poor.  There is also a more 
general concern in this setting and that is: in a court of law the purported"
"evidence should be transparent and contestable. The parties should know 
what it is and be able to argue about it. But many ML systems can lack 
transparency and not be revealing about their inner mechanisms (Liu 2019; 
Abebe et al. 2022) . There are also many other examples of poor, and"
"potentially damaging, classification software (e.g. credit ratings, job 
application assessments, mortgage lending decisions) (O’Neil 2016) . 
 
Computer software does not have to be unreliable. Some software can be 
proven to be correct — there are mathematical proofs that the software"
"meets its specification. Other programs can be validated and evidence, and 
certification, provided that they meet requirements. There is a considerable 
portion of software engineering given to correctness and assurances of 
performance in mission critical settings. The development of programming"
"languages and programming techniques has been in part driven by the need 
to produce quality in the face of complexity. Any computer science graduate 
will have had exposure to questions of how to ensure that a program is 
correct and how to produce evidence that it is. Just to give a couple of"
"examples: - there is Unit Testing, where test code is written at the same time 
as the actual programming and run automatically over and over as the 
program develops, and Extreme Programming, which emphasizes 
teamwork in the actual programming. That said, there still can be"
"196 unreliability in the end result, and, in the case of ML, there is another 
factor. Many of the programs are quasi -empirical.  
 
ML and DL can often be more akin to empirical science than they are to 
traditional computer science and the practices of software engineering."
"What is being asserted here? In general, our knowledge can be divided into 
empirical knowledge and non -empirical knowledge. Empirical knowledge is 
knowledge assured by observation and experience. One form of empirical 
knowledge is that provided by science. Scientific method includes"
"deliberate experimentation, random controlled trials, natural experiments, 
and the like. Science is conjectural and fallible — there is the permanent 
possibility of error. It is also, for the most part, implicitly or explicitly,"
"probabilistic (Howson and Urbach 2006) . The theories, explanations, and 
predictions involve probabilities. In contrast, non -empirical knowledge, for 
example, mathematics, is knowledge assured by logic and reason. It is not 
usually conjectural, fallible, or probabilistic."
"Computer programs, their correctness, and our knowledge of what they do, 
are generally in the domain of the non -empirical. (There are exceptions 
such as non -deterministic algorithms, genetic algorithms, and so forth, but"
"these are but small paddocks in the large continent of computer science.) 
ML and, especially, DL, is another matter altogether. It is on the empirical 
side of the divide — it is quasi -empirical — and, also, most of its predictions 
are probabilistic."
"Many DL systems are black boxes — quite how they work internally in 
specific implementations is often unclear. Then whether they actually do"
"197 work as anticipated is often a matter of experiment and empirical test. 
Evidence is gathered by providing the systems with data and seeing if they 
behave as they should. The testing is made more complicated by the 
probabilities simply because any probability other than 0 or 1 is consistent"
"with any actual outcome in the world. For example, if risk assessment 
software predicts that a specific felon has an 80% chance of re -offending, 
that prediction is not refuted by the felon not re-offending. (Just as, if the 
weatherman does not have to be wrong by saying that there is an 80%"
"chance of rain and then, actually, in reality, it turns out that there is  no rain  
on the day in question .) Science itself is empirical, and it has evolved 
techniques for dealing with the probabilities. So , DL is not beyond"
"redemption here — it is just that there are challenges and deeply entrenched 
fallibility. Humbleness is the order of the day.  
 
7.7 Bias in the Context of Wider Machine Learning 
Programs  
 
Let us first consider what ML can and cannot do to address unfairness and"
"representation in a general setting. This is important for librarians to know. 
Librarians offer education in 'information literacy'. Knowledge of the 
properties of ML will increasingly become a core aspect of this. Then we"
"will look at ML unfairness, representation, and classification, specifically in 
the case of librarianship."
"198 7.7.1 Fairness ('Distributive Justice')  
 
The economic, political, and social frameworks that each society 
has—its laws, institutions, policies, etc. —result in different 
distributions of benefits and burdens across members of the"
"society. These frameworks are the result of human political 
processes and they constantly change both across societies and 
within societies over time. The structure of these frameworks is 
important because the distributions of benefits and burdens"
"resulting from them fundamentally affect people’s lives. 
Arguments about which frameworks and/or resulting 
distributions are morally preferable constitute the topic of 
distributive justice  (Lamont and Favor 2017) . 
 
ML has little or nothing to add to the vast and supremely important topic,"
"or concern, of being fair, the topic of distributive justice. ML is statistics 
concerning facts, it does not offer moral guidance.  
 
However, ML can itself supply facts that allow decisions to be made. Also, 
research in ML has also produced some surprising results concerning"
"fairness (e.g. some obvious strategies for being fair can harm the folk they 
are trying to be fair to).  
 
We need some background to introduce ML into a discussion of being fair 
and unfair. Assume a classification is going to be done into two classes on"
"the basis of a single numerical score (see, for example, (Wattenberg, Viégas, 
and Hardt 2022)  and (Hardt, Price, and Srebro 2016) ). These classes are 
used to make a prediction for entities that are being classified, and resulting"
"prediction is either correct or incorrect. An example might be a judgement 
on whether a person will pay back a mortgage, using 'credit -worthiness' as 
the numerical score. We have information, or data, on the past scores, and"
"199 we also have information, or data, on whether the borrowers paid their 
mortgages back. The data may be like this : 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 20. Graphic depicting defaulters and repayers against 
'credit -worthiness' . 
 
The intention here is to depict that anyone represented by a red dot (i.e."
"with a credit score between 0.4 and 1.5) failed to repay their mortgage, 
whereas everyone represented with a green dot (i.e. with a credit score 
between 2.4 and 3.6) did repay their mortgage. It is easy in a case like this 
to put in a credit score that classifies or divides the borrowers into"
"defaulters and repayers — having a credit score of 2, or above, will do it"
"200  
 
 
Figure 21. Graphic depicting defaulters and repayers against 
'credit -worthiness' with a cut -off line.  
 
This putting in of a cut -off line — a 'threshold classifier' — is a 'theory' that 
works perfectly on past data, and we will assume that it holds good with"
"future data going forward. It is a theory that may have been devised by ML, 
or it may have been produced in many other ways. (After all, mortgage 
companies had similar theories long before the arrival of ML.) Problems"
"with the theory start to arise if in the actual data these two regions overlap, 
say"
"201  
 
Figure 22. Graphic depicting defaulters and repayers against 
'credit -worthiness', where there are false positives and false 
negatives.  
 
With the data depicted in Figure 22, there is no way of putting in a 
classification boundary that does not make some errors. There are two"
"kinds of errors that might be made in respect of repayment: false positives 
and false negatives.  The false positives are where the classification suggests 
that borrower will repay, but the borrower does not. The false negatives are"
"where the classification suggests that borrower will not repay, but, actually, 
the borrower does repay. For example, say a boundary was at credit 2.0, as 
in Figure 22, there is one false positive and one false negative. Of course, in"
"a real case there might be thousands o f borrowers, and hundreds of false 
positives and false negatives. No matter where the cut -off line is put there 
will be errors of these kinds. It is inevitable with this data.  Statistics has"
"techniques for adjusting theories  to minimize errors. We will not invoke 
those here. Instead, we will leave this part of the discussion noting that"
"202 likely there will be false positives and false negatives.  (Please see Appendix 
C for a further explanation of false positives and false negatives.)  
 
That there are going to be errors is not a good result. Maybe the 
composition of the single score could be improved so as to separate the"
"classes.  This single number credit -worthiness score would typically be an 
amalgam of many other numbers, i.e. features, for example, salary, number 
of years of employment, family size, etc.,  adjusted with weights to reflect"
"their importance. A DL approach would typically add features (any features 
not required would just end up with weight zero). This might help. But 
there will always be other general worries about the training data, whether 
the sampling properly represents the target population, whether the data"
"on the features and the predictions (the labels) are correct, and so forth. A 
prudent conclusion might be that there will always be errors.  
 
There is another aspect to what we know and what we do not know here. 
We know only probabilities. We do not know of a particular future"
"borrower whether that individual borrower will repay. We know, for 
example, of borrowers like that borrower (i.e. ones with the same credit 
score) that, say, there is a probability of 90% that they will repay.  
 
Let us move on from a factual judgement (on who is going to repay) to"
"policy. Just as far as the actual lending goes, the mortgage company does 
not have to act inexorably on the advice or prediction of its repayment 
theory. It may have other reasons for lending or not lending. For example, 
it may have only so many funds to disburse and thus be forced into not"
lending to some clients whom the company knows would be perfectly good
"203 repayers (or would have a very high probability of repaying). Let us now 
understand the cut -off in a slightly different way, as a major input to policy 
regarding future applications — that it is a main factor in separating those 
suitable for a loan from those not suitable ."
"The boundary of suitability can be adjusted to alter the proportions of false 
positive 'suitables' or false negative 'unsuitables'. For example, the 
mortgage company could potentially loan to every applicant (i.e. the cut -off"
"would be at a credit score of zero); then there would be no false negatives 
(but, presumably, a number of false positives). Or, it could move the cut -off 
far to the right and have no false positives (but a number of false negatives)."
"The mortgage company has choices. There are going to be errors. But the 
kinds and numbers of errors can be manipulated.  
 
Now let us introduce fairness. Among the features in the single number 
credit -worthiness score there may be values for attributes, for categories,"
"that would merit scrutiny in the context of bias and fairness, for example 
categories like gender and race. In this area of research, these categories are 
known as protected  or sensitive  features or categories.  
 
Let us introduce a fictitious sensitive category, Shape, which has two values"
"{circle, cross}. We can show these on our diagram."
"204  
 
Figure 23. Graphic depicting defaulters and repayers against 
'credit -worthiness', where there are false positives and false 
negatives and protected features.  
 
Is our theory unfair on Shape? What might 'bias' mean in this context? How"
"might we counteract bias? For the moment let us set aside the question of 
whether shape, e.g. being a cross, may cause a borrower to be a better or 
worse repayer. We will come back to that.  
 
Here are some suggestions (Hardt, Price, and Srebro 2016; Corbett -Davies"
"and Goel 2018; Kusner et al. 2018)  
 
Approach 1 ('unawareness' or 'anti -classification'): Ignore the 
property of Shape. The suggestion is that it is unbiased, or not 
unfair, over Shape, in as much as it ignores Shape. Analogically, in"
"a more realistic setting, the suggestion is that one way to avoid 
bias over Race and Gender is not to have, or not use, any data on 
race and gender. There are two problems with this, though. Shape 
(or Race or Gender) may be correlated with other features that"
"have to potential to serve as proxies for the protecte d attributes. 
For example, maybe all the crosses live in one zip code, and the"
"205 circles in another zip code. Then a strategy of ignoring shape, but 
using zip code, may lead to, or reveal, unfairness on Shape even 
though the algorithm does not directly use data on Shape. It is 
better to have data on Shape and to prove that the algorithm"
"produces fair results (using an acceptable definition of fairness 
and a technique for achieving it.) The second problem is that the 
protected attributes may indeed have a causal relation to the 
predicted outcome label. It may be that the crosses are better"
"repayers than the circles, so omitting information on this may 
produce a theory, a cut -off, that is less accurate (leads to more 
false positives and false negatives). This may seem unlikely or 
implausible in a mortgage repayment example. But i n a medical"
"setting, it is known that there are many differences between the 
races  and genders . Whites, in the US, are more prone to certain 
heart conditions (e.g. atrial fibrillation) than other races (Dewland 
et al. 2013) . Sickle -cell anemia is predominantly a disease of those"
"who live in sub -Saharan Africa (and descendants of earlier 
residents of that region) (Rees, Williams, and Gladwin 2010) .  
Women, and not men, have reproductive systems for bearing 
children. Men, and not women, are exposed to the possibility of"
"prostate cancer. Women live longer than men. It seems that 
information on race and gender would be useful in medical 
settings. The systems would need to be 'fair' in their uses of that 
information, but not using the information at all does not seem to"
"be the right move.  Ignoring sensitive attributes can lead to 
unfairness with those the system is trying to be fair to. Female 
violent felons have a lower rate of recidivism than do male violent 
felons. Omitting gender from recidivism calculations may lead to 
harming women."
"Approach 2 ('demographic parity'): separate the data into two sets 
of data (two graphs) — one for circles, the other for crosses — then, 
potentially, use a different cut -off for each ensuring that the same 
proportion are candidates for loans. So, for example, if there are a"
"thousand crosses, and the cut -off for crosses leads to 10% of them 
qualifying for loan, then set the cut -off for circles to ensure that 
10% of them qualify (whether there be 100 circles or 10,000 
circles). Some defense can be made of this,  in certain"
"circumstances. But consider the true negatives, on either graph. It 
may be that a mortgage company, following the demographic 
policy, has to lend to borrowers that they know will not repay. At"
"206 an extreme, say all the crosses repay and none of the circles do 
(i.e. repayment is causally related to a protected attribute). If 10% 
of the crosses are offered loans, then the demographic policy 
requires that 10% of the circles also be offered loans, even though"
"they are not going to repay. This actually does not seem fair to 
anybody (or to the company).  
 
Approach 3 ('equal opportunity'): again, separate the data into two 
sets of data into two graphs — one for circles, the other for crosses."
"And, again, there will be two cut -offs. But this time the cut -offs 
focus only on those who are judged to be repayers. Then, the cut -
offs are set to ensure, in so far as it is possible, that the same 
proportion of circle repayers and the cross repayers are offered"
"loans. If you are classed as a repayer, there is equal opportunity of 
being offered a loan, whether you are a cross or a circle. 
(Wattenberg, Viégas, and Hardt 2022)  and (Hardt, Price, and 
Srebro 2016)  favor this approach. Presumably there is the"
"problem with it of false negatives. Say you are a repaying cross. 
Some of those are going to be incorrectly classified as non -
repayers (i.e. they are false negatives). But once they are (wrongly) 
classified as a non -repayer they will not have an equal opportunity"
"of anything. They are not going to be offered a loan and nor do 
they have a chance of being offered a loan. It may be that equal 
opportunity is fair for the group but not necessarily fair for every 
member of the group individually."
"Approach 4 ('counterfactual fairness'): (Kusner et al. 2018)  
suggest the following. Work with individuals only. Then require, 
and prove, that the probability of getting a loan for any individual, 
who is actually a cross, is exactly the same as the probability of"
"that same individual getting a loan, had that individual been a 
circle (i.e. counterfactually being a circle) and similarly in the 
other direction, from circles to crosses. That is, data on sensitive 
attributes is obtained and used. But it is used to show that the"
"outcome results would be the same for all in dividuals even were 
the values of those sensitive attributes were different. This 
approach certainly plumbs a central intuition. For example, under 
it, with race, whether you are black or white does not matter as far"
"as your probability of getting a loan is concerned. While 
counterfactual fairness is different conceptually to demographic 
parity, Rosenblatt and Witter have proved that the two lead to"
"207 equivalent outcomes (L. Rosenblatt and Witter 2022) . 
Demographic parity is easier to work with.  
 
To sum up. Fairness in ML algorithms is an active research area. There are 
a number of proposals. Most of them have merits and shortcomings. Since"
"there are probabilities involved, with false positives and false negatives, it 
seems unlikely that any suggestion on fairness in ML, can, at one and the 
same time, be fair to all individuals, to all groups, and to all related parties."
"Most of the proposals can be proved mathematically to hold, or not hold, of 
the relevant ML systems. There can be evidence and accountability. Which 
theory of fairness should be used is not a matter for the ML programmers"
"to decide. It belongs with distributive justice, and it is a decision for the 
wider constituents.  
 
There is a take home here. If there is a test that has false positives and false 
negatives (and pretty much all real -world tests do — medical tests, driving"
"license tests, law school admissions tests, etc.). And if some, many, or most 
of the false positives have some other property (say, having the race of 
'green', or 'being a cross'). Or if some, many, or most of the false negatives"
"have some other property  besides testing negative  (say, having the race of 
'red', or 'being a circle '). None of that, by itself, means that there is any 
evidence  whatsoever  of unfairness . Further analysis is needed — further"
"statistics, or further mathematics. Epidemiologists — one group with a 
knowledge and interest in these methodologies — have tools at their 
disposal. One is causal diagrams. The use of causal diagrams, with 
appropriate data, can provide (fallible) evidence for fairness or unfairness."
[Causal diagrams are explained and discussed further in Appendix D.]
"208 7.7.2 Debiasing Representation  
 
Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? 
(Bolukbasi et al. 2016)  
 
That attention grabbing question, or phrase, is part of the title of an 
important paper by Tolga Bolukbasi and fellow authors . What they are"
"alluding to is that natural languages have associations in them which reveal 
assumptions about gender stereotypes. Sometimes these assumptions are 
innocent, harmless, and possibly even useful, such as the association 
between being a Queen and being female. Often, though, associations"
"between words can be suspect and perhaps even revealing of undesirable 
underlying biases, such as that between 'receptionist' and 'female'. A 
problem in the context of ML is that if ML uses natural language as data, 
and it often does, the resulting ML programs might entrench or even"
"amplify the biases. While this Bolukbasi paper focusses on gender 
stereotypes, it also would have application with racial or religious or other 
stereotypes. (See also (Caliskan, Bryson, and Narayanan 2017) .) 
 
This type of bias is different to the unfairness biases of allocation, for"
"example, as to who gets mortgages and who does not. Rather, this is to do 
with biases of representation, with natural language processing (NLP) and 
with removing unwelcome stereotypical associations. Natural languages 
change, of course, and unwelcome stereotypical associations come and go."
"How to interact with that in a positive way is a larger question. But 
reducing bias, or 'debiasing', text which is used as input data to ML is a 
distinct possibility. The Bol ukbasi paper has definite sound proposals on"
"209 this. It is not being asserted here that text for ML can be 'purified' perfectly. 
However, the text can be improved, and it should be possible to ensure that 
ML programs do not amplify existing biases in language."
"There can be other harms of representation in addition to those strictly in 
NLP. For example, there can be such harms with the labeling of images — 
the attachment of metadata to images . In the case of the single sentence"
"characterization of an image there might be denying people the opportunity 
to self -identify , reifying social groups, stereotyping , erasing, and demeaning  
(and probably further types) (Wang et al. 2022) .  
 
7.7.3 Panopticon Bias, the Panopticon Gaze"
"Certainly  computers, artificial intelligence, and ML are enabling 
surveillance as never before. Examples of this are readily available in 
librarianship. There are recommender systems which can recommend 
books, articles, music, films, etc. that individual patrons might like. But to"
"do this, the systems have to know what at least some patrons have read or 
explored in the past. Likely, patrons will have to give up some privacy to get 
the value -added intermediation of recommender systems. A more extreme"
"example is that facial recognition software could track everything that every 
patron does in a physical library. This would be completely against the 
ethos of librarianship.  
 
Facial recognition technology certain raises questions. It is a technology"
that allows the identification and tracking of individuals. These days it is
"210 pretty good in a technical sense i.e. good at identifying and tracking. But , 
Nick Thieme asserts : 
 
AI’s unique talent for finding patterns has only perpetuated our 
legal system’s history of discrimination... Since people of color are"
"more likely to be stopped by police, more likely to be convicted by 
juries, and more likely to receive long sentences from human 
judges, the shared features identified are often race or proxies for 
race. Here, computational injustice codifies social injustice. 
(Thieme 2018)"
"Joy Buolamwini  has written on topics related to this. One of her early 
papers observes that she — a person of color — was largely invisible to 
computer systems, then later she offers the view that computer facial 
recognition was a technology of discrimination against people of color"
"(Buolamwini 2019; 2016; Race, Technology, and Algorithmic Bias  2019) . 
She has a new 2023 book Unmasking AI: My Mission to Protect What is 
Human in the World of Machines  (Buolamwini 2023)  The American 
Library Association also have a piece, now mildly dated (American Library"
"Association 2018) . We can all agree that recognition and tracking is a 
creepy technology that seemingly we can do without.  
 
Or can we? There are many occasions when there is a need to know a 
person’s identity — i.e. who the person is. In librarianship, there is the need"
"to know who the patron is that is checking out the books.  To establish 
identity there needs to be some gold standard, some difficult to forge 
validator who se original is on file or permanent record somewhere. 
Biometrics offers a way in here:  it can use image s of faces, fingerprints,"
"images of irises, DNA, and similar . Right now, facial images are by far the"
"211 best combination of ubiquity and convenience. More -or-less everyone in 
the US has  ID (identification)  and that ID is going to be a driving license , a 
Real ID equivalent, a passport, a Green Card, or similar. All of these carry"
"an image , a photo,  identifying the holder of the ID. We can add to this folk 
who unlock their smartphones using a scan of their face. Facial recognition 
itself is now so good that it can recognize a person , in person,  from a"
"suitable image  with 99% or more accuracy  (quite what this 99 % figure 
means is another question) . Let us insert an anecdote. In June, 2023, the 
author flew from Dallas to Paris on American Airlines. When boarding he 
walked straight on to the aircraft in seconds, being identified by facial"
"recognition (the airline, a long with many others, already had a scan of his 
passport). Now, this facial recognition presumably was being trialed and 
not mandatory. But, also presumably, objectors would have had to produce"
"their passports, to have printed and produced their boarding passes, and to 
have spent  minutes with thes e processes. There will be no need to make 
facial recognition mandatory for these kinds of circumstances. We will all"
"want it, for convenience. We will be falling over ourselves to get it. [Hot off 
the press, The Independent  headline 7/18/2023 'Eurostar passengers 
leaving London can skip passport checks with new facial recognition tech'. ] 
Separately, more than a few sporting venues use facial recognition"
"technology to identify season ticket holders and to admit them without fuss 
or muss  (Gee 2023) . The US Immigration and Naturalization Service use 
facial recognition at airports to identify persons of interest.  The author has"
"been through INS at US airports many times. Every time until recently the 
INS agent took his fingerprints. On coming back from Paris in 2023 this did 
not happen. The agent told him that it was no longer necessary. Who knows 
why? INS must have had all the identification they needed. Perhaps from"
"212 facial recognition? It is hard to see all this being rolled back.  Facial 
recognition has uses which are absolute winners. Of course, tracking people 
24 hours a day, 7 days a week is an entirely different matter.  There are"
"companies (e.g. IBM) who say they will not sell this technology to the police 
(Peters 2020) . There is a n important  difference between being recognized 
through  a driving license in a pocket and being identified by facial"
"recognition. Ordinarily, a n officer  of the law,  or similar, would have  to ask 
to see a driving license in a pocket, and the person asked might consent or 
refuse to  reveal it. Then this kind of transaction would not scale, say to"
"10,000 people in a crowd at a protest. Facial recognition, though, can work 
with or without assent and it scales easily to many thousands of faces.  
 
7.7.4 Bias in (Librarianship) Classification  
 
This topic is included in Chapter 7 Machine Learning Bias and 
Librarianship."
"7.8 Stochastic Psittacosis: LLMs  and Foundation Models  
 
The three reports or papers On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation 
Models  (Bommasani et al. 2022) , Language Models are Few -Shot 
Learners  (Brown et al. 2020) , and On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots:"
"Can Language Models Be Too Big?  (Bender et al. 2021)  have a wealth of 
material on potential harms arising from Large Language Models or 
Foundation Models. We need to be aware of some of the problems."
"213 Large Language Models are large, no surprises there. Then what they do, 
essentially is cloze tasks (see Section 3.5, for an explanation of cloze tasks). 
This can lead to many other abilities (question answering, chatting,"
"reasoning etc.). Nevertheless, what seems to be happening is probabilistic 
symbol manipulation on a grand scale. There is no doubt that some of these 
systems would pass the Turing Test (which at one point in time was taken 
to be an indicator of whether a system had intelligence (Oppy and Dowe"
"2021) ). Nowadays received opinion is that the Turing Test is not 
demanding enough. There is the open question of whether there is 
emergence here. One view is that as the cloze tests, and the models 
mastering them, get ever more elaborate, something 'emerges' from the"
"complexity, and perhaps that emergent property is true intelligence or even 
consciousness or sentience. A contrary view is that we can easily fool 
ourselves over apparently intelligent behavior. Maybe even 50% of the 
population would think that the ELIZA chatbot is either a real person or"
"some truly intelligent software. The contrarians would just view the LLMs 
as being more complex symbol manipulators. This debate matters in the 
following way. We need to be cautious and skeptical towards what these 
modern sophisticated models have to say and recommend. We do not really"
"know how they work in detail. Nor do we know, or can explain, the 
reasoning that produces many of the specific results. They have 
characteristics of a black box or oracle. Viewing them as stochastic 
parrots — to use (Bender et al. 2021) 's	delightful label — lessens our awe in"
"what they seem able to do.  
 
One potential harm is misuse. GPT -3 can write, say English, as well as a 
native educated speaker. This opens some unwelcome possibilities:"
"214  
Any socially harmful activity that relies on generating text could 
be augmented by powerful language models. Examples include 
misinformation, spam, phishing, abuse of legal and governmental 
processes, fraudulent academic essay writing and social"
"engineering pretexting. Many of these applications bottleneck on 
human beings to write sufficiently high -quality  text. Language 
models that produce high quality text generation could lower 
existing barriers to carrying out these activities and increase their 
efficacy  (Brown et al. 2020) ."
"Basically, there is very little that can be done about this. It may become 
possible for other AI applications to recognize, and maybe filter, machine 
written text. If the writer application always puts in a ‘watermark’ (some 
giveaway combinations or sequences of words), it might be easy to"
"recognize AI generated text. Using a machine to generate text is not always 
bad. For example, summaries of text, journal articles, and even entire 
document collections, can be exactly what readers require.  
 
Another potential harm is bias. Bias is a huge and complex topic (as we"
"have been seeing). Just briefly here we will use Kate Crawford's distinction 
between harms of allocation, harms of representation, and harms of 
classification (Crawford 2017) . Harms of allocation, e.g. fairness in the 
availability of mortgages, should be able to be addressed. Within the"
"bounds of sloth and fallibility, unfairness can be detected and remedied. 
Harms of representation, e.g. Muslim -violence bias (Abid, Farooqi, and Zou 
2021) , are a much harder case. There are hundreds of training data sets of 
(English) samples. The ones of these that are large and containing"
"substantial source material from the Internet (e.g. from Common Crawl) 
will have some biased content. Then, if the training data has bias then so"
"215 too will GPT -4 and similar large models. To address this, there seem to be 
two central possibilities: to keep the unacceptable bias out of the training 
data, or to remove the bias from the model's output. Neither of these is"
"promising. The systems use self -supervision on the training data precisely 
because it is near impossible to curate and label with the quantity involved. 
It may be that some software could filter the training data in some way. But"
"that might not be entirely suitable. GPT -4, if it is going to have an all -
around knowledge, needs to know about biased content (for example, 
holocaust denial). It 'just' needs to know that the biased content is biased 
and to not write biased content when writing in its own voice. Working on"
"the output probably is not much better. Our experience with filters (e.g. 
using blacklists) on the Internet is not good. Filtering the word 'breasts', for 
example, to filter pornography tends also to filter 'breasts' in the context of"
"breast cancer. It may be possible with systems like GPT -4 to instruct the 
systems themselves to remove biases of representation. For example, to 
provide examples of, say, anti -Muslim bias and prompt the machine to 
remove material like this from its reasoning and output. Harms of"
"classification also are tricky and require attention. The actual classification 
categories used to classify people for some purpose, for example, usually or 
often depend on historical period, culture, and social factors (Hacking"
"1999) . But training data for a foundation model will usually favor one time, 
place, and culture. This issue is also seen with medical data. There are 
many labeled sets of medical data. But many of them would not be good as"
"training data. One reason is classification categories and diagnoses can 
change through time. Views of homosexuality in the 1950s, for example, are 
different from those of today."

7.9 Supplement: The Bias of Programmers  
 
7.9.1 The 'Biases' of Professional Programmers  
 
… [the] possibility of programmer biases being encoded, in some 
way, in their programming artifacts.  
Contrary to making an error, which represents a single incident in"
"which one makes an incorrect judgment, a bias is a systematic 
tendency to commit the same type of error over time or in 
different situations  (Johansen, Pedersen, and Johansen 2021) . 
 
This kind of bias has absolutely nothing to do with bias in the sense of being"
"unfair to anyone over race, gender, social status, economic status, etc.  
 
A typical workflow process for a professional programmer at work on an 
individual program is that there will be a specification that the program 
must meet. There will be a 'house style', which is how the programs are to"
"be written, for the employer, or for the open -source project, or for the 
intellectual area in question. When the program is first completed, and 
continuously thereafter, it will be subjected to quality assurance (including 
'debugging'). The program will be shown to meet the specification. Th e"
"programmer will have learned programming in MIT, Stanford, Princeton, 
Lomonosov State University in Moscow, or in many other worthy 
institutions including polytechnics and community colleges. They may even 
have learned from online sources  or have been self -taught. They will have"
"learned a style  of programming. Not every programmer is different from 
every other programmer — definitely there are styles among programmers."
"217 These are not 'biases'. All programmers make errors, but they will catch 
most of these in the debugging (and if they cannot, likely the program will 
not meet the specification). Most of the types of bugs are known. For"
"example, there is an 'off -by-one-error' in a loop. (We need not worry about 
what this is.) Even the best programmers can make an off -by-one-error, but 
if a programmer has the systematic tendency to make off -by-one-errors (i.e ."
"they are biased over this), basically they need to find a new line of work.  
 
Johanna Johansen et al. argue that : 
 
… each program probably  encodes the cultural and cognitive 
biases of their creators  (Johansen, Pedersen, and Johansen 2021) . 
[Emphasis added.]"
"and they offer evidence to this end. They even offer evidence of priming 
(that is, they can 'prime' a programmer to exhibit specific cultural and 
cognitive biases). Theirs is important work. But let us look at how it 
proceeds. There is a programming task — to write or sketch a program — but"
"they omit any real specification for what the program is supposed to do. In 
this way they place the programmer in a condition of uncertainty. Then, 
their method suggests, the programmers reveal their cultural and cognitive 
biases in their decisions on what the program is to do, what the"
"specification might be, (and this can be primed).  While this research is 
important and addresses a rarely researched area, we find it unconvincing. 
Your mileage may vary. But our mileage is — if there are no specifications,"
"all bets are off. There are starting to be other research papers in this area, 
and Johanna Johansen et al. provide a valuable guide to these (Johansen, 
Pedersen, and Johansen 2021) ."
"218  
7.9.2 The Biases of All of Us as Programmers  
 
Pretty much all of us are programmers. There are six and a half billion 
owners of smartphones in the world ( (Turner 2018)  updated to 2022). That 
is over 80% of the world's population. Those phones likely have"
"applications ('apps') on them, and settings. They are configured. That 
configuration, in conjunction with the host operating system and 
infrastructure, amount to a suite of programs, a cluster of software and 
software infrastructure. The owners of the phones, or their friends, or"
"(young) relatives, or delegates will establish or program the configurations. 
There is a lot of programming going on. There will be extensive bias in the 
sense of systematic mistakes in the programming, and also the phone will"
"enable bias, prejudice, in the sense of bringing to light unfair views or 
opinions about other human beings.  
 
The importance of this is that to a large degree how our own smartphone s, 
and similar, are set up are within our own control. We can reduce bias if we"
"wish to. What we need is 'information literacy' and configuration agents to 
implement the prescriptions.

Librarianship  
 
8.1 Introduction  
 
Let us start this Chapter by revisiting the paper by Su Lin Blodgett et al. on 
bias in NLP (Blodgett et al. 2020) . The abstract to this, in full, is :"
"We survey 146 papers analyzing “bias” in NLP systems, f inding 
that their motivations are often vague, inconsistent, and lacking in 
normative reasoning, despite the fact that analyzing “bias” is an 
inherently normative process. We further f ind that these papers’"
"proposed quantitative techniques for measuring or mitigating 
“bias” are poorly matched to their motivations and do not engage 
with the relevant literature outside of NLP. Based on these 
findings, we describe the beginnings of a path forward by"
"proposing three recommendations that should guide work 
analyzing “bias” in NLP systems. These recommendations rest on 
a greater recognition of the relationships between language and 
social hierarchies, encouraging researchers and practitioners to"
"articulate their conceptualizations of “bias” —i.e., what kinds of 
system behaviors are harmful, in what ways, to whom, and why, as 
well as the normative reasoning underlying these statements —and 
to center work around the lived experiences of members of"
"communities affected by NLP systems, while interrogating and 
reimagining the power relations between technologists and such 
communities  (Blodgett et al. 2020) .  
 
This paper is very thorough in its reasoning, evidence, and citations. Please"
"read it. We will take from it its three recommendations , applying them to 
librarianship :"
"222 1. Recognize the relationships between language and social hierarchies.  
2. Encourag e researchers and practitioners to articulate their 
conceptualizations of 'bias'—i.e., what kinds of system behaviors are 
harmful, in what ways, to whom, and why, as well as the normative"
"reasoning underlying these statements . 
3. Center work around the lived experiences of members of 
communities affected by [the]  systems . 
 
Some material for the first recommendation is in (Blodgett et al. 2020)  
itself. The third recommendation requires extensive outside empirical"
"research which we are not equipped for. That leaves as our focus:  
 
…what kinds of system behaviors are harmful, in what ways, to 
whom, and why, as well as the normative reasoning underlying 
these statements . 
 
There is a vast literature on bias in information provision (and, of course,"
"information provision includes librarianship). But much of this literature 
has a wider ambit than librarianship. It wants, for example, to 'interrogate' 
internet companies, and power structures of one kind or another in society 
as a whole. No comment is passed on that here. We need focus on ML."
"There is an intersection of ML, bias, and librarianship, which we will 
explore shortly. But, as a summary of what is to come. There is a pr oblem 
with data. ML needs data to learn from. But at least some potential data 
from traditional librarianship might have unwelcome aspects to it. For"
"example, an ML program could easily learn the cataloging task of applying 
Library of Congress Subject Headings  (LCSH) to new books and resources. 
But some fear that the LCSH labels themselves are suspect. So, according to"
"223 some, bringing ML into it would just be to 'reify White Supremacy' (Cordell 
2020) . 
 
8.2 Harms of Omission  
 
In Christianity, no doubt among other places, there is the distinction 
between sins of commission and sins of omission — the first is doing"
"something that should not be done, the second is failing to do something 
that should be done. Similarly with harms associated with ML: some are 
harms of commission, others harms of omission. When Crawford et al. 
discuss bias in terms of harms of allocation, harms of representation, and"
"harms of classification (surveillance), and Suresh and Guttag extend this 
out to 7 harms, these are all harms of commission (Crawford 2017; Suresh 
and Guttag 2021) . But information providers, including librarians also have"
"an interest in something different. Provision is an aim, or to use a word 
with a wider span: 'service'. Failure to provide service can be a harm. It 
would be a harm of omission.  Harms of omission are a little harder to deal"
"with at a methodological level than harms of commission . With a harm of 
commission, what or who did it — the causal agent — is available. Whereas 
with omission, what or who did not do it — the absent causal agent — often 
needs to be identified  and may not be identifiable ."
"8.3 What to Digitize  
 
As mentioned in Section 1. 4, ML algorithms need input data in the form of 
computer digital text i.e. as structured sets of 0s and 1s. For text sources, or 
text corpuses, that are not born digital, this raises the question of what to"
"224 digitize. In some areas, the practice certainly has been to digitize primarily 
what might be characterized as being 'white', 'colonial' resources: White 
libraries, newspaper collections of White newspapers, and so forth. This is a"
"tricky area. We know from the fate of the Google Book project that many do 
not want their resources digitized, or even the resources of others (see 
Chapter 1.2). Also, we know that many peoples, tribes, or indigenous 
peoples, do not want some of their cultural artefacts recorded at all, let"
"alone digitized.  In contrast, there is the argument that digitization selection 
can be an anti -racist action (see, for example, S.L. Zeigler, Digitization 
Selection Criteria as Anti -Racist Action  (Ziegler 2019) )."
"Perhaps the ML research and practical initiatives can stay on the sidelines 
in this debate. As Elizabeth Lorang et.al. write, concerning the Library of 
Congress's role : 
 
… the technology itself will not be the hardest part of this work."
"The hardest part will be the myriad challenges to undertaking this 
work in ways that are socially and culturally responsible, while 
also upholding responsibility to make the Library of Congress’s 
materials available in timely and accessible ways  (Lorang et al. 
2020) ."
"8.4 Search, Primarily Using Search Engines  
 
Search is a filter. The searcher is initially faced with some pages, a site, a 
collection of sites, or the entire Internet, then search reduces the rich vista 
to something suitable for the occasion. The vista is filtered."
"225 There are different possibilities here, and different possibilities for 
distortion or bias. If the Search algorithm uses keywords, spelling 
correction, semantic correction, stemming etc., various mistakes or 
manipulations can occur. Louis Rosenfeld et.al. report that an early"
"instantiation of a search engine on Amazon responded to searches for the 
subject ‘abortion’ with the question ‘do you mean ‘adoption’?' (Rosenfeld, 
Morville, and Arango 2015) . This suggestion is rather more than spelling"
"correction. It is also regularly reported that various configurations of search 
engines misdirect searchers for 'abortion providers' to 'adoption agencies'. 
Search sometimes works via recommender techniques comparing the"
"searcher and the searcher’s task to similar searches by other patrons. What 
happens here depends on which groups the search is compared with, and 
this can be, in some sense, fair or biased. Usually, a search returns a list of"
"links in order of relevance. Now, relevance is topic, person, and occasion 
dependent (Frické 2012) . It depends on the keywords, the person searching 
(different people may get different results from the same keywords, and the 
occasion (the same person may get different results from the same"
"keywords on different occasions). The latter two features or aspects depend 
on the degree to which the engine is tracking the User (and the engine does 
need to be aware of previous searches in order to disambiguate, narrow, 
and help the User). There is also manipulation of various kinds. For"
"example, there is Search E ngine Optimization (SEO) which is tricking the 
engine algorithms to place some  urls or  links higher than they otherwise 
would be. It is known that most Users will not look beyond the first few"
"links that are returned from a search. This might not matter for the supply 
of 'pure' information. But, for example, if you were a commercial entity, you 
would prefer to have the links to your products within those first few. The"
"226 provider of the links prefers this, not necessarily the User. There are 
companies that provide those services. The returns may thus be affected by 
paid interests, such as advertisers, retailers, or political groups (although"
"most engines will identify paid links). The search engine companies try to 
identify the techniques of SEO and to immunize or neutralize them. It is a 
continuing battle. But even among algorithms that rank by genuine ‘merit’,"
"there can be different, and sometimes equally acceptable but orthogonal, 
views of merit. [Orthogonality here means this. Consider the example of 
sports cars: is the one that goes faster better than the one whose looks are 
more head turning? Or vice -versa? It is hard to know. The two properties"
"are orthogonal — they are independent one with the other.] Search is a filter 
infused with judgments and values (and orthogonality).  
 
Some areas of the Internet are cesspits. That is one side effect of ease of 
content creation and freedom of speech. Safiya Noble, in her book"
"Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism , reports  
that her 2009 search engine query for 'Black girls ' returned the porn site 
'HotBlackPussy.com ' as its first hit. Later studies — 2011 onward — 
produced similar results for the search 'Black girls ' (and also for searches"
"for 'Asian girls ', 'Asian Indian girls ', 'Latina girls ', 'White girls '). One 
conclusion that Noble draws is : 
 
… girls’  identities are commercialized, sexualized, or made 
curiosities within the gaze of the search engine. Women and girls"
"do not fare well in Google Search —that is evident  (Noble 2018) .  
 
These specific results have changed out of all recognition now, 202 3 
(possibly in part as a result of Noble's research )."
"227  
What a search engine returns for a query does not depend solely on the 
query. It depends also on who is asking the query — that is what 
personalization does — and the occasion and history of the question being 
asked. Having the query 'black girls' (and similar) answered with links"
"including porn sites certainly gets our attention. But what specifically is the 
harm here and who is being harmed? Some of the folks asking this kind of 
search question might be offended by this kind of answer (and some might"
"not be, and some may even by pleased by it). Working to correct offense is 
tricky, which is not to say that it is not worth doing. The harm seems to be  
elsewhere , with girls, in general, and of having their identities 
commercialized, sexualized, or made curiosities . It is a harm of"
"representation.  Search engines have made adjustments in this area.  
 
Some years ago, when the world wide web was just starting, there were 
curated pages of links on topics. These pages were authored by humans. 
For example, Lycos and Yahoo did this. These curated pages are like"
"bibliographies, even annotated bibliographies, that a librarian might 
produce. They did not have or use keywords as lead -ins. Had there been a 
curated page on 'Black girls' it may well have been neutral as to range of"
"topics, in so far as that is possible. Nowadays, there are just too many pages 
and too many links to make this practical. Certainly, there are 'pillar pages', 
or 'topic pages', or 'topic clusters' (see, for example, (Clariant Creative"
"Agency 2022)  ). These are somewhat similar to the old , curated pages, but 
likely they will have been generated by computer program (possibly a ML 
program)."
"228 If, in a reference interview, a reference librarian was given the keyword 
string 'black girls', they almost certainly would think that it is under -
specified. A librarian would ask for clarification and disambiguation. 
Search engines sometimes do that, with overly long keyword strings, but"
"generally they are in the realm of guesswork. Once a search engine has an 
initial return click among first list of links, it can usually improve the 
suggestions. So, usually searching is a process, not a one -shot question and 
answer."
"Also worthy of mention are autocomplete (autosuggestion), and 'trends'. 
Google, to take an example, will autocomplete a partial search string on the 
Google Chrome Browser. Here is what it did for the author on  10/27/2022 
for 'black girls' :"
"229  
 
Figure 24. Screenshot of Autocomplete on the String 'black girls' . 
 
We do not  see anything untoward in that list. Google explains how 
autocomplete (and Trends) work on the page : 
 
https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/7368877?hl=en#"
"zippy=%2Cwhere -autocomplete -predictions -come -from  
 
In part, this reads : 
 
Autocomplete is a feature within Google Search that makes it 
faster to complete searches that you start to type. Our automated 
systems generate predictions that help people save time by"
"230 allowing them to quickly complete the search they already 
intended to do.  
Where autocomplete predictions come from  
• Autocomplete predictions reflect real searches that have 
been done on Google. To determine what predictions to 
show, our systems look for common queries that match"
"what someone starts to enter into the search box but also 
consider:  
• The language of the query  
• The location a query is coming from  
• Trending interest in a query  
• Your past searches  
These factors allow autocomplete to show the most helpful"
"predictions that are unique to a particular location or time, such 
as for breaking news events.  
In addition to full search predictions, Autocomplete may also 
predict individual words and phrases that are based on both real 
searches as well as word patterns found across the web."
"Difference between autocomplete & Google Trends  
Autocomplete is a time -saving  but complex feature. It doesn’t 
simply display the most common queries on a given topic. That’s 
why it differs from and shouldn’t be compared against Google 
Trends."
"Trends.  
Google Trends  is a tool for journalists and anyone else who wants 
to research the popularity of searches and search topics over time.  
 
Notice here that autocomplete adapts to the User.  
 
One general point to be made in all this is that the search engines are in"
"competition one with another. They have incentives. In broad sweep terms, 
they need to be providing what the Users want, or need, or what is useful or 
valuable to them. Nowadays, Google has dominance with search engines. 
But that was not always so, and it does not have to be so going forward."
"There are various kinds of anonymous, non -tracking engines, and also 
straight -out competitors. In the absence of diktat, the Users will choose."
"231  
8.5 Social Media, Dis -, Mis - and False -Information  
 
It is a jungle out there, and some ML programs have the potential to make 
the situation worse. ChatGPT can write English better than most English 
native speakers and writers. Essentially, readers would have difficulties in"
"judging that ChatGPT English output had been written by a machine. 
ChatGPT could write disinformation tirelessly 24 hours a day 7 days a week. 
There is not much that librarians can do about this, apart from providing 
good education on information literacy. It may be that other ML programs,"
"or even ChatGPT itself, could detect that samples of written English had 
been written by machine. This might be somewhat similar to plagiarism 
detection software. But being written by a machine does not of itself have to 
be bad. ChatGPT can abstract or summarize text. Summarizing today's"
"newspapers, or this month's research journals, might be welcome and 
valuable.  
 
8.6 Bias in the O rganization of Information  
 
8.6.1 Introduction  
 
Traditional librarianship has devised such techniques as the ‘organization"
"of information’ (content and container classification, abstracting, indexing, 
the use of surrogates, controlled vocabularies, thesauri, and the like)  (Chan 
2007; Rowley 2000; A. G. Taylor 2004) ."
"232 There are  questions  of bias  associated with these processes. To mention 
some : 
 
• access to information, for individuals or groups, can be encouraged or 
discouraged  
• straight out knowledge, or viewpoints, or theories, or beliefs or nexus 
of values can be conveyed or imparted"
"• attitudes towards the information resources  themselves (including 
cognitive attitudes in the sense of social epistemology  (Fallis 2006) ) 
can be manipulated  
• Mill’s diversity of views (Mill 1869)  can be promoted or obstructed"
"• Aristotle’s diversity in the components of a good life  (Wilburn 1999)  
can be promoted or obstructed  
 
Potentially there are many topics that could be discussed here. We will 
restrict ourselves to a few.  
 
[Appendix A has explanations of some slightly more technical librarianship"
"terms that are used in Section  8.6: 
1. emotive content: A.5  
2. controlled vocabularies: A.2  
3. classification and act of classification: A.6  
4. taxonomies: A.1  
5. thesaurus: A.1  
]"
"233 8.6.2 Be Careful, and Sparing, with Emotive Content  
 
The use of emotive content is valuable in advertising — it can help to sell 
things. It is also valuable in literature itself — it can manipulate our 
attitudes in liking or disliking characters and into becoming engaged with 
the story."
"Librarians need to be careful with this, though. Any keywords, tags, subject 
labels, index terms, and so forth need to be low on emotive content. They 
need to be neutral. The reasons are: emotive content can produce harms of"
"representation, and the use of emotive terms in indexes, say, or other 
stepping stones to content, will distort access.  
 
ML systems should have little or no problem with avoiding emotive 
content. Large language models can just be prompted not to use emotive"
"content. Some of the modern systems may be able to be given one example 
('one shot') and then they will minimize emotive content.  
 
8.6.3 Warrant and Controlled Vocabularies  
 
A question is: where do the terms in a Controlled Vocabulary (CV) come"
"from and what is the evidence or justification for introducing and using the 
particular terms that are used in a specific CV? There is a word or concept 
for this consideration. It is 'warrant' (Barité 2018) . Warrant is important to 
us. It is one point where bias might arise."
"234  
There are different theories of warrant. We will briefly mention three: 
literary warrant, user warrant, and cultural warrant. Before explaining 
those, let us introduce a sample potential term for inclusion in a CV or"
"some CVs : 'Gypsy Moth'. This is an example of a term that might have bias. 
Sabrina Imbler tells us in a 2021 article entitled This Mothʼs Name Is a 
Slur. Scientists Wonʼt Use It Anymore  that:  
 
The Entomological Society of America will no longer refer to"
"common species of insects as “gypsy moths” and “gypsy ants,” 
because their names are derogatory to the Romani people  (Imbler 
2021) .  
 
The article continues in part : 
 
For Ethel Brooks, a Romani scholar, the move is long overdue."
"As a child in New Hampshire, Dr. Brooks loved watching worms 
and caterpillars crawl across her hand. But one particular 
caterpillar, the hairy larvae of the species Lymantria dispar, 
terrified her. The larvae would swarm and strip the leaves from a"
"tree, leaving behind so much destruction that people sometimes 
called them a “plague.” But no one blamed L. dispar. Instead they 
blamed “gypsy moth caterpillars,” the species’ common name.  
“That’s how they see us,” Dr. Brooks remembered thinking as a"
"child. “We eat things and destroy things around us.”  
Dr. Brooks, now chair of the department of women’s, gender and 
sexuality studies at Rutgers University in New Jersey, has spoken 
out against the use of the pejorative in fashion and college"
"parades, she said. But Dr. Brooks never imagined the pejorative 
could be stricken from its use in the more staid realm of science.  
“It’s hideous and super racist and it’s hurtful,” she said. “But what 
can you do about it?”  (Imbler 2021) ."
"[To put some editorial interpretation here. Dr. Brooks is probably 
talking of the word 'Gypsy' as being 'super racist', not the phrase 
'Gypsy Moth'.]"
"235 The name 'Gypsy Moth', or 'Gipsy Moth' (its British spelling) has not just 
been used for insects.  Around 1930 the de Havilland  aircraft company 
produced the Moth series of aircraft, which included the Gipsy Moth (and 
the related Tiger Moth, Puss Moth, Hawk Moth, Swallow Moth, Hornet"
"Moth, etc.). When the supply of war -surplus eight -cylinder engines ran out, 
Geoffrey de Havilland  designed the powerful and reliable four -cylinder 
Gipsy engine which was then used in the Gipsy Moth. The Prince of Wales"
"owned a Gipsy Moth (you can see him portrayed flying it on the television 
series The Crown ). Amy Johnson flew a Gipsy Moth single handed from 
Britain to Australia (roughly 11,000 miles at a flying speed of 100 mph).  
 
No other planes in their time and place so thoroughly served the"
"advance of aviation (and civilization) in so many diverse ways as 
the de Havilland  Moths  (Harris 2002) . 
 
Separately, Gipsy Moth IV is the ketch that Sir Francis Chichester sailed 
single handedly around the world in 1967 (Chichester had worked earlier"
"on the Gipsy Moth aircraft). It is reasonable to assume that Geoff de 
Havilland  and Francis Chichester were not intending to demean their 
creations in any way by their choices of words 'Gipsy' or 'Gipsy Moth'. Quite 
the opposite, the names were intended to be positive descriptors. After all,"
"de Havilland  was selling mass produced airplanes. Then the items 
described, the engine, and the aircraft, turned out to be superlative. 
Additionally, Amy Johnson, the aviatrix, '  … was one of the most influential 
and inspirational women of the twentieth century  (Gillies 2020) '. All was"
"good for 'Gipsy Moth' in these domains, these periods, and these cultures. It 
is hard to imagine that any Romani were offended by 'Gipsy Moth' in the 
1930s."
"236  
The idea of literary warrant comes from E. Wyndham Hulme at the 
beginning of the twentieth century. Lois Mai Chan  et.al. summarize it  
 
…the basis for classification is to be found in the actual published 
literatur e … (Barité 2018; Chan, Richmond, and Svenonius 1985)"
"There is a slight difficulty or ambiguity here. What is 'actual published 
literature'? In 1911, that would have been published physical books that 
could be placed on shelves in libraries. But nowadays we have digital"
"publication, e -Books, web pages, the Internet, and so forth. We need to take 
a wider view. Nevertheless, literary warrant would provide a motivation to 
using 'Gypsy Moth' in the 1930s, in the 2020s, and in the 2020s about"
"historical 1930s literature, both in the sense of identifying an insect and 
identifying a training aircraft. Computers would be a great help here. The 
software does not necessarily have to be ML software. The processing has to"
"look through the 'actual published literature' which it will be able to do 
really well (for all literature available in digital form). Notice here that with 
literary warrant there is one CV for all, whatever the area of focus is for that"
"CV. The 'actual published literature' is the same for everybody. It is not one 
thing for one group of users, or culture, and another for a different group of 
users or culture.  
 
User warrant focusses on the User. It is the User or the Patron (or, god"
"forbid, the 'customer') that is trying to find the resources. Identifying the 
Users is not the easiest, nor is identifying how they do their searches. In the 
case of a public library, using say Dewey Decimal Classification, one might"
take the view that the Users are the 'public'. But it is also possible to be
"237 more granular than this, patrons looking for materials on insects likely will 
be a different group to those looking for resources on historical aircraft. If 
the CV is for a smaller and more limited collection (e.g. for the index for a"
"catalog for an aircraft museum), the tasks may be easier. Once again, 
computers are a great help. If patrons type into some kind of search box or 
Online Public Access Catalog  or Discovery System , it will be easy to know 
what searches are being carried out. Nowadays most searches will be free"
"text searches. The patrons can type in whatever they like and the software 
will learn what they do like. This time there can be several different CVs for 
the same collection of literature — one for one group of users of that"
"literature and another for a different group of users of the same literature. 
Search software can personalize searches (as it would do for a private 
computer at home as opposed to in a public library).  
 
Cultural warrant focusses on the cultures of groups of potential users of the"
"resources. It is similar to user warrant in that there can be several different 
CVs for the same collection of literature — one for one culture of users of 
that literature and another for a different culture of users of the same"
"literature. There can be obvious benefit in 'localizing' some CVs to place, 
time, beliefs, lifestyle, etc. i.e. to culture (no matter what literary warrant or 
user warrant might suggest in these cases). For example, legal systems can 
vary from state to state and country to country."
"What are library practices here, and how can ML help (or hinder)? 
Typically, librarians will use universal systems, such as LCC, LCSH, DDC, 
to catalog, or provide metadata, for their resources. These CVs depend 
largely on literary warrant, sometimes with cultural adjustment. There is"
"238 widespread dissatisfaction with these CVs, particularly with cultural 
aspects. For example, Elizabeth Lorang et. al. write : 
 
Previous and ongoing collecting and description practices  … were 
and are colonialist, racist, hetero - and gender - normative, and"
"supremacist in other structural and systemic ways  (Lorang et al. 
2020) . 
 
Assume so. Were ML to use these practices going forward presumably it 
would just entrench them. (Mind you, if existing cataloging practices 
continue as is, without ML, there also presumably would be"
"entrenchment.). ML does have the capabilities of correcting whatever 
shortcomings a CV might have.  It certainly can reduce emotive content and 
provide cultural adjustment where required. Really some guidance is 
needed from librarians. For cataloging, librarians need to work themselves"
"towards unbiased universal CVs (in so far as that is possible). ML can help 
with this (and also with the automation of insertion of values into the 
metadata fields of the resources).  
 
What about 'Gypsy' and 'Gypsy Moth'? LCSH has this : 
 
Gypsy"
"Gypsy  
USE subject headings beginning with or qualified by the 
word Romani for topics related to the Romani people, e.g. 
Art, Romani; Romani poetry  
 
Gypsy moth [the insect, use as is]  
 
Gypsy Moth (Training plane)  
USE Moth (Training plane)  
(Library of Congress 2022)"
"239 This basically is literary warrant with some cultural correction. Notice, 
though, that using 'Moth' for 'Gypsy Moth' is asking for trouble with the 
precision of searches (because there are many other kinds of Moth training"
"planes e.g. Tiger Moth etc.) Let us spell this out. You are interested in books 
on Gypsy Moth (Training plane) , so you look up that subject in LCSH and 
learn that the catalogers have used Moth (Training Plane) for this topic, so"
"you now search for Moth (Training Plane) and your search returns books 
on Tiger Moth, Puss Moth, Hawk Moth, Swallow Moth, Hornet Moth, 
Gypsy Moth etc. (most of which you do not wish to have). So, trying to be 
culturally sensitive, which we all want to be, has come, in this case, at the"
"cost of ruining a search, and providing good searches is one thing librarians 
aspire to.  
 
8.6.4 The Act of Classification Has Consequences  
 
Obviously. In a court of law, classifying the accused as 'guilty' is rather"
"different to classifying him as 'not  guilty' (in terms of what the future might 
hold for him). So too for poisons, grades of scholarship applicants, and 
most everything else in daily life. (And, indeed, so too for being classified"
"‘black’ in (now fortunately historical) apartheid South Africa.)  
 
Whole books have been written largely on this (cf. (Bowker and Star 
2000) ). Independently of the particular classification  of items , we have 
noted how the accidental or intentional manipulation of the emotive"
content of equivalent concepts can affect attitudes to those things named.
"240 Here are some of Sanford Berman’s examples from the 1970s, and earlier, 
Library of Congress Subject Headings  (S. Berman 1971) : 
 
'Yellow peril', ‘Negroes, etc.’, ‘Mammies’, ‘Idiocy’, ‘Idiot asylums’, 
‘Lunacy’, ‘Indians of North American, Civilization of,’"
"‘Slaughtering and slaughter -houses —Jews’, ‘Barbarian invasions 
of Rome’, ‘Delinquent women’  
 
Classification is also fallible, in common with all human cognitive 
endeavors. We know this directly from our everyday knowledge that anyone"
"can make a mistake. We know it also from the test -retest unreliability of 
professional classifiers (catalogers) using precision and highly designed 
classification schemes  (Snow 2017) . If a classifier can classify the same item"
"twice in two different mutually incompatible ways, classification is fallible.  
 
The act of c lassification is also subject to bad -faith or ‘rogue’ cataloging.  
Everyone does this, all the time, pretty well every day. Faculty do it when"
"they call a less than stellar student paper an ‘A’.  And some professionals do 
it too, fortunately not so often, perhaps when they have a private attitude, 
or strong feelings, which misdirect their work (and which, for example,"
"might lead them to classify an information resource  on abortion in such a 
way that the resource  is difficult to find).  
 
Classification is also subject to cultural factors. For example, different 
cultural groups have different attitudes to suicide, and thus different"
"propensities to classify deaths as suicides, and this means that classification 
will not be isomorphic across cultures (independently of fallibility and 
rogue  behavior )."
"241  
In sum, the act of classification has consequences, can be used to produce 
attitude manipulation, is fallible, can be malfeasant, and has a dependency 
on culture.  Some of the harms here are harms of representation, some are"
"of allocation. Allocation can be seen as a harm of commission (doing 
allocation but not doing it fairly) or a harm of omission (failing to do 
allocation for certain groups or cultures).  
 
8.6.5 Taxonomies Have Consequences"
"Taxonomies that have subclasses, i.e. most of them, make true or false 
assertion s which are claims to knowledge. Asserting that one class is a 
subclass of another is a factual or conceptual piece of knowledge. For 
example, if a biological taxonomic scheme has whales as being a subclass of"
"mammals, then it is offering the assertion that whales are mammals. Some 
of these schemes are intended to be objective i.e. they represent scientific or 
mathematical knowledge. Others are inter -subjective — for example, the 
Nurse Intervention Classification mentioned in Appendix A — and those"
"represent decisions or conventions.  
 
Some  schemes can be  problematic . Consider subjects , or topics,  like 
‘creationism’ and ‘evolution’ which we might be  wanting to put into a 
hierarchical scheme  of topics  which allows them to inherit from some of"
"‘scientific theory’, ‘false scientific theory’, ‘pseudo -scientific theory’, 
‘religious view’, and ‘blasphemy’.  What are we to put where? Well, who 
knows? Certainly , different groups of people would choose differently, and"
"242 different groups of people would disagree over which is a right or 
acceptable or appropriate classification. So , now any classification scheme 
does not so much contain knowledge, or, at least, uncontroversial 
knowledge, it does, however, contain or assert, a point of view (for example,"
"one scheme might assert that creationism is a false scientific theory).  There 
is a difference here between objective schemes and inter -subjective 
schemes. A mathematical classification that places the integers as a 
subclass of the reals is objectively right or wrong about that (and"
"mathematicians can provide insight as to which that is). Similar 
considerations apply to the elements in Chemistry, or species in Biology.  
 
Sanford Berman enlightens us that the 1970 Library of Congress Subject 
Headings are ‘biased’, and he means by this largely that they have"
"unwelcome emotive content  (S. Berman 1971) . Berman also locates the bias. 
It lies with the classification schemes which are : 
 
…parochial, jingoistic Europeans and North Americans, white -
hued, … Christian … heavily imbued with the transcendent,"
"incomparable glory of Western civilization (S. Berman 1971)   
 
Hope Olson echoes Berman telling us that the Headings reflect : 
 
…the exclusionary cultural supremacy of the mainstream 
patriarchal, Euro -settler culture’  (Olson 2000) ."
"And Bowker and Star wax long about generalizations of this: that the 
powerful subjugate the weak by imposing their will through classification  
(Bowker and Star 2000) . (See also, (S. Berman 2000; Knowlton 2005; 
Olson 2002) .)"
"243  
Alright, but all schemes are ‘biased’ — biased in that they reflect a point of 
view (or knowledge, or beliefs, or opinions). We have to work with this . It is 
not an insurmountable problem. As Poincaré once remarked (about the 
indispensability of a point of view, when observing) :"
"He is no longer a slave who can choose his master  (Poincaré 1905)  
 
Then there are the conjectured conspiracies, surface or hidden, whereby the 
strong use classification to batter and imperialize the state of nature 
blissful. No comment  on that  here ."
"ML did not cause the problems in older library taxonomies (since they pre -
date ML). However, care is needed to ensure that it does not prolong the 
issues. It may be used to counter -act them.  
 
8.6.6 The Current State of Libraries and Their Organizational 
Systems  
 
Melissa Adler writes :"
"… libraries are complicit in privileging and circulating ignorance —
inhibiting rather than opening up bodies of literature as sources of 
various knowledges (Adler 2017, 2) .  
[Editorial note: 'Knowledges', plural, is an unusual form which"
"perhaps has some currency in the sociology, or cultural aspects, of 
knowledge.]  
 
Elizabeth Lorang and fellow authors  write :"
"244  
Previous and ongoing collecting and description practices, for 
example, were and are colonialist, racist, hetero - and gender - 
normative, and supremacist in other structural and systemic ways. 
These understandings are the foundation on which training and"
"validation data will be created and assembled; they will become 
reinscribed as statements of truth, even as we elsewhere champion 
the potential of computational approaches to uncover hidden 
histories, identities, and perspectives in collections. To engage"
"machine learning in cultural heritage must mean confronting 
these histories, committing to the hard work of acknowledgment 
and rectification, and not simply reproducing them and giving 
them a whole new scale of power. There should not be a future for"
"machine learning in digital libraries that is not first and foremost 
committed to, in the words of Thomas Padilla, “responsible 
operations” and to all of the ongoing, cross -cutting work that 
responsible operations entail.  (Lorang et al. 2020)"
"The Thomas Padilla work alluded to  is (Padilla 2019)  Responsible 
Operations:  Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI in Libraries  and in 
turn  this cites influence from Rumman Chowdhury (Chowdhury 2023) .  
Padilla writes : 
 
Chowdhury defines responsible operations as collective"
"investments in, “ . . . processes to combat algorithmic bias.” 
(Padilla 2019 Note 6)  [Seemingly , the original sources no longer 
exist.]  
 
Padilla's Report is a research position paper for OCLC. It is substantial. We 
will just briefly mention the section on Managing Bias.  Padilla writes :"
"Bias management activities have precedent and are manifest in 
collection development, collection description, instruction, 
research support, and more. Of course, this is not an ahistorical 
frame of thinking. After all, many areas of library practice find"
"themselves working to address harms their practices have posed,"
"245 and continue to pose, for marginalized communities.  As libraries 
seek to improve bias -management activities, progress will be 
continually limited by lack of diversity in staffing; monoculture 
cannot effectively manage bias.  Diversity is not an option, it is an"
"imperative  (Padilla 2019, 9) .  
 
Then he suggests the holding of meetings, holding symposia, convening 
working groups, etc.  
 
8.6.7 Designing Information Taxonomies for Librarianship  
 
Classification and classification schemes are important in helping Users"
"meet resources . Professional librarians, and similar, are users  of 
classification, not designers  of classification. Almost no librarians produce 
classification schemes, and, with the advent of copy cataloging, truly few 
librarians classify resources ."
"Here are some of the balls to be juggled. Classification is the most effective 
if it is in terms of the concepts, world -view, and values of the Users (‘User 
warrant’ as opposed to ‘Author warrant’). But rarely are the Users a 
homogenous group. We all of us are simultaneously members of many"
"different groups (male/female, old/young, Republican/Democrat, 
filmgoers, those interested in sports, gay/straight, etc.). And many of these 
groups truly define ‘a culture’. We are all simultaneously members of many 
different cultures. Which culture, or cultures, is the classification  designer"
"aiming at? Presumably, something in the middle.  A starting point is for the 
designer to wind down any emotive content in the scheme, and wind up the 
correct cognitive content. A quiet toned neutral, always fallible, cultural"
"246 absolutism would be the starting point. Less emotion and more knowledge 
generally facilitates access.  
 
But designing  is not so eas y. Let us talk websites for a moment. Consider 
trying  to design a website for the Flat Earth Society. Now, the classification,"
"in terms of that culture, would reflect a point of view, indeed a somewhat 
extreme and false point of view, not knowledge. So , there is a switch here to 
cultural relativism. Folk not part of that culture, normal folk, might struggle"
"with using the resulting website. But the site might not have been designed 
for them, and perhaps this does not matter. Normally, the duties of 
stewardship require that the Information Professional get the data right 
(for example, with Credit Card Bureaus).  But a classification designer"
"might  have the need to get the data as the Users believe it to be, not as it is.  
The designer might also be asked to increase emotion or manipulate 
attitude, and not to be neutral. What would be wrong with the Luxury 
Jeweler’s website classifying some of their diamond rings as ‘Truly"
"gorgeous’, ‘Prince Charming’ s choice’, ‘Sugar daddy ’s specials’, etc.? But 
then there are cases like a White Supremacists’ Web site. Here, let us guess, 
what the Users want is something expressing false views in an extreme 
fashion, possibly even hate speech."
"The absolute limits seem to be freedom of speech. If what is envisaged is 
protected speech, ethically or legally protected speech, then the designer  
can instantiate it. He or she may have personal misgivings, in which case"
"they  should just not undertake a task  of the kind that gives rise to worry. 
There can also be professional and societal misgivings that add caution to 
freedom of speech, as we will see. Of course, there are many ways"
"247 computers and websites can change attitudes, for example, there is 
‘captology’ — the persuasive use of computers  (Fogg 2003) . 
 
8.7 Navigation : Metadata Supported and Otherwise  
 
Conceptually, metadata for an individual information resource seems to be"
"just a table of field -value pairs, where semantically the field -value pairs 
cover container metadata (such as Print Date, Physical Location (if these 
apply)) content metadata (such as Subject Matter) and mixed container -
content metadata (such as Author, Title). All this seems to be entirely"
"independent of navigation by a User from information resource to 
information resource, if such an operation is appropriate.  
 
However, this is not quite right. Quite a lot turns on the nature of the values 
used in the field -value pairs. Obviously, one resource may have the same"
"author as another resource and a patron may want to navigate to other 
books by the same author. Then dates, as values, have obvious relations to 
each other (e.g. earlier date, later date, same date). A similar point is true of"
"locations. Then for metadata values for fields like subject matter, the values 
would likely come from a controlled vocabulary, possibly a thesaurus. 
Typical thesauri will support generic, instance, and partitive relations. In"
"turn, these support navigation following these relations. For example, a 
book might have a metadata subject field value of ' rhopalocera ' and a 
patron might want  to navigate to  another book, or books, on a similar but"
"more general topic — of course, the topic is 'lepidoptera' and that to pic will 
be a metadata field value on other books. The metadata is here supporting 
navigation, bu t it is doing so in conjunction with a thesaurus or"
"248 classification scheme. If that classification scheme is 'biased', the actual 
navigation might be distorted.  
 
In the traditional case, using information resource s which were paper 
pages, structured and co -located into books, placed on shelves, placed in"
"libraries, placed in buildings, the mere physicality of the information 
resource s enhanced certain styles of information resource  to information 
resource  navigation (for example, the patron browsed along a shelf from 
one structured information resource  to the next). The use of surrogates"
"(such as cards in card catalogs) liberated this to a degree (you could have 
several cards for each book and thus, using the indirection of the surrogate, 
you could make a book have as many near neighbors as you wished). When"
"computers are used as a tool in classification and navigation, generalization 
is complete. A computer can easily transform views and presentations and 
it can easily provide different views of the same computer ' information"
"resource locations'. Computers also can and will make free and extensive 
use of surrogates. For example, web links, or hyperlinks, are surrogates, 
and there can be thousands of links to the same one web page; and, in turn,"
"those links can be organized and displayed in various ways.  The designer  
can make it easy or difficult to navigate from information resource , or 
collection of information resource s, to another information resource , or 
another collection of information resource s. Navigation, browsing and"
"reading navigation, is a filter.  
 
Navigation and search pose similar problems. They can be used to 
manipulate access. The designer  needs to be competent enough to know 
what might happen. Generally, from diversity considerations, one wants to"
"249 widen access. But there are many problematic cases discussed in librarian 
literature: - access to dangerous true material (dangerous to the User (e .g. 
‘how to commit suicide’), dangerous to employer (e .g. ‘how to hack a web"
"site and steal credit card numbers from it’), dangerous to society (e .g. 
‘reservoirs near you and how to poison millions of people using them’), 
access to inflammatory false material (eg Holocaust denial literature), and 
many other cases besides  (Froelich 2004; Hauptman 1988; 2002; M. M."
"Smith 1997; Wolkoff 1996) . Traditionally, librarians have been fairly ‘hands 
off’. They argue d that they have no assured knowledge as to the uses that an 
information resource  will be put to, therefore, as policy, they can just"
"supply information resource s and not worry further.  Nowadays, they are 
more cautious. ML should be able to help, no matter what the policy is.  
 
8.8 Ethical Arguments  to Underpin Assertions of Harms 
of Bias  
 
There are  ethical concerns that are the province of all informational"
"professionals, such as: freedom of speech, freedom of access, privacy, 
intellectual property, stewardship, and the like. There are Codes of Ethics 
for various professional bodies associated with librarianship . Such code s"
"usually  build off  distinctions between personal and professional ethics, 
duties to an employer, to the profession, and to society as a whole  
(American Library Association 2021; American Association of Law 
Libraries 2019; Society of American Archivists 2020; IFLA 2012) . These"
"can be a great help. More fundamental than any code would be the 
principles of non -maleficence (‘do no harm’), autonomy (‘let people choose 
for themselves’), informed consent (‘give people the requisite information"
"250 for choice’), and perhaps even the Golden Rule (‘treat others as you would 
like them to treat you’). And more fundamental still would be rights, duties, 
and ethical consequences.

"251 Chapter 9: What Might Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) Bring to Librarianship?  
 
9.1 Introduction  
 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and 
artificial intelligence . It is concerned with enabling computers to interact"
"with  natural languages such as English, French, or Chinese. It involves the 
use of algorithms and computational models to analyze and derive , and 
produce,  meaning from human language in both written and spoken forms.  
 
NLP made a huge step forward with the advent of Large Language Models"
"(LLMs), such as : 
 
1. Google's PaLM2 2023 Pathways Language Model 540 billion 
parameters  (Narang and Chowdhery 2022) . There is now AudioPaLM  
which  is a large language model that can speak and listen (Rubenstein 
et al. 2023)  There is PaLM -E for robots (Driess 2023) ."
"2. Databricks's Dolly 2.0, 2023  
3. Meta 's LLaMA  family (Large Language Model Meta AI ), 2023  
4. Microsoft's XLNet  family  (Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for 
Natural Language Understanding) , 2019  
5. OpenAI's GPT -X family  (Generative Pre -trained Transformer 3 , 3.5,"
"4), 2020 , 2023"
"252 Not all NLP relies on machine learning, or, indeed, on LLMs, but a good 
proportion does so.  
 
While Natural Language Processing primarily addresses natural languages, 
quite often the resulting software can be applied to images, videos, or"
"sounds. Such software is 'multi -modal'. This comes about because the 
underlying substrate is just numbers. Text is reduced to numbers, and so 
can images, for example. Then some of the algorithms are equally at ease 
with numbers sourced from text , numbers sourced from images , numbers"
"sourced from sound recordings, numbers source from video, and so on . 
 
NLP is becoming of increasing import to librarianship.  
 
9.2 The Pre -Processing Pipeline  
 
An NLP program typically will some pre -processing of the text prior to"
"doing its actual task. Here are some of the steps that might be carried out:  
 
• Format Normalization. This is the conver sion of the text to a desired 
standard format (e.g. by making it all lowercase  and removing 
redundant spaces or special characters )."
"• Word Tokenization. This  will split the string or stream of characters 
into words or tokens. Usually this would involve looking for spaces, or 
periods, or separators between groups of characters.   
• Base Form Normalization. Linguist often view words as consisting of"
"a base form (a 'morpheme') plus, possibly, a prefix and/or a suffix."
"253 For example,  the word 'transportation' consists of (trans + port 
+ation). There are techniques to get the base form.  
o Stemming . This means 'reduced to their root form'. So, for 
example, 'consult', 'consults', 'consulting' would all be stemmed"
"to the root form of 'consult'. The result of stemming does not 
always have to be a well -formed word; for example, 'change' 
and 'changing' would be stemmed to 'chang'.  
o Lemmatization. There is a similar technique  to stemming — 
lemmatization — which does reduce tokens to a root word"
"('change' and 'changing' would be lemmatized to 'change').  
• Parts Of Speech (POS) tagging. This identifies whether the individual 
tokens are nouns, or verbs, or adjectives, etc.  
• There also can be the dropping or omitting of 'stopwords'. Words like"
"'a', 'an', 'the' etc. do not carry much information and so usually can be 
omitted.  
• Dimension Reduction . More than a few times there are many more 
words or tokens in the source than are needed for the processing. For 
example, a novel might have more than 100,000 words in it, but an"
"algorithm might need only 100 words, the right 100 words, to 
determine its genre. There are techniques for reducing the amount of 
input (and thus reducing the amount of time and the cost of the 
processing).  
• In the case of LLMs, the tokens (the processing units that they work"
"with) would often be larger than single characters but smaller than 
entire words."
"254 These pre-processing techniques are also used occasionally with in current 
librarianship . For example, in classical information retrieval  one approach 
is to try to match a 'vector' of a query to 'vectors' of documents. With this,"
"tokenization, stemming,  dropping stopwords, and, possibly, a TF -IDF 
calculation, will have been done on the text of the documents to produce 
the 'vectors'.  [To explain the TF-IDF calculation.  A simple way of 
identifying which document, among many documents in a corpus, is"
"relevant to a search is to consider how often a term appears. So, for 
example, a search for information about Toyota cars might look for how 
often the word 'Toyota' appears in the different documents. What is 
desirable is that 'Toy ota' appears frequently in the document to be returned"
"but not frequently, relatively speaking, in the other documents in the 
corpus. The calculation Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency 
(TF-IDF) determines this. ] 
 
Going forward from the pre -processing, some of the later techniques will"
"use a 'bag of words' approach. With this only the words (the tokens or 
lemmatized words) matter — what the words are and the number of times 
they occur. Other techniques will look at the grammatical structure of the 
text and perhaps try to parse some or all of it.  Yet others might  use text"
"embeddings.  
 
9.3 Text Embeddings  and Similarity  
 
We have already mentioned word  embeddings  in the context of 
Word2Vec — see Section 3.8 — and the problem there was to determine 
whether two different words had the same or related meanings. But there is"
"255 the similar, but more general , problem of determining the degree to which 
two entire text strings are related , or similar, to each other . For example, 
one of these text strings might be a search  or query  string that a User has"
"entered and the other text string might be that of a complete document  in a 
document collection — if these two are related we might theorize that 
perhaps the document has some relevance to the search. Text  embeddings"
"are one technique to address text string similarity. There are many different 
ways of producing text embeddings , and there are many different free and 
commercial software applications to do it (for example,  Sent2Vec , FastText ,"
"Doc2Vec , or Gensim ). Almost all of them will produce a vector (i.e. a list) of 
numbers to represent the strings and also provide a measure that reveals 
how similar two vectors are.  So, as an example, OpenAI's text-embedding -"
"ada-002 model embeds the string 'Stochastic Psittacosis ' to the vector : 
 
[0.012791729532182217, -0.009504193440079689, -
0.007625600788742304, -0.012044000439345837, -
0.012828806415200233, 0.012532186694443226, -
0.005901498254388571,0.003066616365686059, -"
"0.002118050819262862, -0.0020809732377529144, -
0.002658763900399208, 0.024434056133031845, 
0.002084063133224845, -0.02558345906436443  … where there 
are about 1500 further numbers in the list.]  
 
The source texts strings can be of almost any length.  Although it would be"
"usual to split up long texts into chunks.  So, for example, a text document 
could be split into chunks (into chapters, pages, paragraphs, sentences etc.) 
then vector for a search string could be matched into  vectors for those"
"chunks and the relevant chunks  have a location or locations with in the 
document. There are some cautions. Modern embeddings can be produce d 
by LLMs. Some LLMs have been trained on data produced or written before"
"256 2020. This means that such LLMs might not perform embedding well on 
more recent text  (text involving recent events, slang, or changed practices 
of speaking or writing) . Then, once you are in the world of LLMs there 
might be bias. So , care is needed is needed to check LLM embeddings for"
"bias.  (There are tests to do this.)  
 
Once there are vectors for strings, and a similarity measure, several  further 
opportunities  become  available . The context here is a corpus of text 
documents  which has been embedded. Additional infrastructure would"
"include a vector store, which is a database of the embedded vectors.  
 
9.3.1 Searching by Meaning  (Semantic Search)  
 
We are all familiar with  'Find',  the string -in-string search tool  which is close 
to universal in word processing, or text editing, software. What this does  is"
"to find  occurrences of  the target word , a keyword,  say 'attorney' for 
example, in a document. But if 'attorney' is the search string it will not find 
'lawyer' (i.e. a synonym). But , in contrast,  embeddings can search by"
"meaning . They search by similarity of vectors. The vector for 'attorney' (or 
for phrases in which it appears) will be similar the vectors for phrases with 
'lawyer' in them. This is a very powerful addition to search.  What it"
"amounts to, roughly speaking, is search with thesaurus support built in.  
This, for example, allows for search by topic or subject matter. Also, 
similarity admits of degrees, so the results returned can be ranked by how"
similar they are to the query string.  This is a type of ranking by relevance.
"257 Semantic search can improve on keyword search even in cases that do not  
directly  involve synonyms. Here is an example from (Fitch 2023) . Consider 
a user interested in the topic ‘the fall of John Major’. [John Major was a"
"prominent British Prime Minister in the 1990s]. Were the patron  to ask a 
librarian about this , the librarian would understand exactly what was being 
sought and likely would be able to find suitable material. But a keyword 
search simply would not work because, for example, there would be many"
"different ways of saying  ‘the fall of’ and, separately, many document sources 
with the words ‘john’ and ‘major’ in them. Searching by meaning should or 
would do better and that would be carried out by checking similarity of an"
"embedding of ‘the fall of John Major’ to embeddings within  the documents 
in the relevant document collection.  There is a striking second example 
provided by Amr Kayid and Nils Reimers of Cohere (Kayid and Reimers 
2022) . They report that Elastisearch (a keyword search engine) returned to"
"the query ‘what is the capital of the United States?’ an article on Capital 
Punishment.  (This happened because of occurrences of the (key)words 
‘capital’ and ‘states’.) Semantic search would not make this kind of mistake.  
 
9.3.2 Research Trails"
"Once there is matching of chunks to chunks, then research problems or 
topics can  be followed automatically from chunk to chunk, document to 
document , far and wide. This also might be useful outside of pure academic"
"research. As examples, it might help with legal cases or with settling patent 
priority disputes."
"258 9.3.3 Classification  
 
Embedding can support classification in different ways. It can facilitate 
clustering. For example, the task of dividing a document corpus into 20, 
say, clusters of similar documents can be carried out by dividing the"
"accompanying vector database into 20 clusters of similar vectors. It can 
facilitate classification using a supplied classification schema such as a 
thesaurus, controlled vocabulary, or ontological vocabulary. It could do this"
"by seeing which vectors in the vector database of the texts were similar to 
the embedding vectors of the schema vocabulary.  
 
9.3.4 One Style of Recommendation  
 
If some sample 'desirable' documents are supplied,  from a User, a group of"
"Users, or from an institution such as a library,  then embedding provides an 
easy way of finding other documents (i.e. recommendations) similar to the 
provided ones and of ranking the recommendations.  
 
9.3.5 Plagiarism Detection"
"The embedded vectors can reveal if two vectors are too similar (maybe even 
that they are identical). This perhaps would suggest that the one source is 
plagiarized from another."
"259 9.4 Named Entity Recognition  
 
Named Entity Recognition  (NER)  is the ability of the software or agent to 
recognize in a source text the references to particular entities, e.g. to 
London or to Sherlock Holmes or to the Korean War. NER can also usually"
"classify the entities into people, places, institutions, etc. The references 
need not be in some canonical form. For example, one journal article might 
have the word 'London' in it and another article the phrase 'the capital of"
"England' — these are two references to the same entity. NER using a large 
language model, such as BERT or a GPT -X, on news articles, research 
papers, social media posts, etc.,  is extremely accurate.  As you would expect,"
"it is not quite as good on new, or extremely rare, entities. However, it is 
plenty good enough for most applications and it is distinctly better than 
humans attempting the same task . There is a difference here between the 
NLP model essentially recognizing or creating the relevant ontology and"
"ontological vocabulary for itself against being provided with an ontology 
and controlled vocabulary to work with. For example, chemists have an 
ontology of elements , and compounds , and NER could use that when 
analyzing research publications in chemistry. Accuracy is higher if the NER"
"is provided with an ontology to use.  
 
NER is valuable for librarians, as it allows a User to  obtain , for example, all 
the articles on London in a collection."
"260 9.5 Topic Modeling  
 
Topic modeling can look at a text or collections of texts and determine their 
'topics'. Th en it can 'tag' those texts with their topics.  There is a slightly 
older way of doing this, and a slightly newer way which would use LLMs 
and embeddings."
"With the older style, t opic modeling  is done by unsupervised learning. So, 
the ML software is clustering the contents of the texts. In the general case it 
needs be told how many clusters to make, and  it does not have any  names"
"for those clusters. It needs to be guided as to  those also. The result is that 
various different parts of the same text , or various different texts , can 
appear in the same cluster, meaning the se parts or texts  are on the same"
"topic as each other. This type of analysis could also be done on documents, 
on paragraphs, on sentences, or on parts of sentences.  To explain this at the 
level of documents. There are some background assumptions here, and 
some  common techniques. The assumptions are a) that each d ocument is a"
"mixture of topics b) that each topic is expressed using a certain vocabulary, 
i.e. using certain words, and c) that any word has a certain probability of 
belonging to the vocabulary for a specific topic. Then the calculation is"
"merely a matter of counting the frequency of particular words (say the 
number of tokens of the word 'car') and seeing how the best clusters of 
words can be formed doing justice to the word clusters and the documents. 
Common techniques include Latent Semantic Analysis (LS A), Latent"
"Semantic Indexing (LSI)  and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) . (The word 
'latent' here means 'hidden' or 'in the background'. See, for example, 
(Manning, Raghavan, and Schütze 2009)  for an explanation of these"
"261 techniques. LDA can classify each document as a mixture of topics (Blei, 
Ng, and Jordan 2003) .) This type of analysis is very quick. So, the analyst 
can certainly experiment by varying the number of topics to find a result 
that is acceptable."
"Were modern style embeddings to be used, the general approach would be 
similar but the algorithms would use embedded vectors from a vector store.  
 
The main use -case s of Topic Modeling are outside librarianship . As  an"
"example , security agencies may have an interest in which new threats are 
appearing  in social media posts. Librarians , in their professional work,  
would typically have existing classification schemes that they would prefer 
to use.  
 
9.6 Text Classification Problems"
"As we have explained under Section 9.3, certain kinds of text classification 
problems can be addressed using embeddings. But there are other 
techniques. There are a number of  text classification problems that share a"
"common ML approach. All that is needed are suitabl y labeled training data , 
produced in conjunction with the desired classification scheme,  and then 
the ML system can classify the actual target data ."
"262 9.6.1 Shelving and Subject Classification  
 
Text classification is similar to topic modeling, but it uses a supplied 
classification scheme. This means that the training of the ML system will be 
different. It will use supervised learning, and that means that there has to"
"be labeled training data (which is always difficult to obtain). Modern 
systems are reasonably accurate.  
 
Classification, especially shelving classification, is something different to 
subject classification, indexing, or CV tagging. With books, and Dewey or"
"LC, for example, a book can only have one slot (this is because it can have 
only one position on a shelf). This requires that the classification is 
exclusive and exhaustive and that each book carries only one, perhaps 
complex, 'tag' (i.e. its call number).  
 
9.6.2 Sentiment Analysis"
"Senti ment analysis, at its most basic, can pick out the emotive tone of some 
text. This might be useful in a commercial setting, for example, to process 
reviews of a product, dividing them into favorable, unfavorable, and"
"indifferent. It typically works using only 'bag of words', i.e. the word tokens 
that appear in a document. It ignores what those words are saying. There 
are training data sets available for sentiment analysis. In that setting,"
"supervised learning would be used to train an ML sentiment anal yzer. You 
can see how a bag of words approach can go wrong with a naïve analyzer."
"263 Say some example favorable words are 'good', 'brilliant', and 'excellent' and 
a text passage is written using negations only e.g. 'the product is neither  
good, nor brilliant, and definitely not excellent'. The review is unfavorable,"
"but naïve sentiment analyzer might rate it as favorable because it contains 
only favorable words.  
 
Modern large language models, such as BERT and GPT -X are very good at 
sentiment analysis. They would not use a bag of words approach. Also, they"
"would not be trained using supervised learning. Likely they would be 
trained using self -supervision followed by reinforcement  learning.  
Sentiment analysis might help librarians  in any situation where they are 
trying to obtain feedback or opinions on items or policies or services or"
"courses of action. The relevant patrons or constituents could be invited to 
provide their input, which then could be processed in whole or in part 
automatically using sentiment analysis.  
 
9.6.3 Author o r Genre Recognition"
"Most of the LLMs can work in 'one shot' or 'few shots' mode. The means 
that their user or programmer just needs to provide a few examples  and 
then the LLM will be able to carry out the task that is illustrated. In turn,"
"this means that merely by providing some examples of an author's work (or 
of books of a genre) and the LLM will be able to recognize which books are 
written by author (or of which books are of which genre)."
"264 9.7 Controlled Vocabularies, Thesauri, and Ontological 
Vocabularies  
 
[Appendix A provides some background on the concepts used in this 
section.]  
 
ML/NLP  can create controlled vocabularies, thesauri, ontologies, and"
"ontological vocabularies for any corpus of text. It would be able to do so 
swiftly . Semi -algorithmic techniques for producing these kinds of 
vocabularies are well known (see, for example, (Zeng 2005) ). In recent 
years, computer support would certainly have been used for these tasks."
"But natural language processing adds power tools.  
 
As a sketch of some of the techniques that might be involved. The terms in 
the documents can be clustered . This would be similar to topic modeling.  
These clusters can be arranged in hierarchies, and favored labels attached"
"to each cluster. That would produce a rudimentary thesaurus and 
controlled vocabulary Possibly, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) , Latent 
Semantic Indexing (LSI)  and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  will be 
used. This will reveal the important concepts that are in use (and their"
"relations). There could be named entity recognition (picking out, for 
example, that 'London' is the name of a thing or entity). There likely would 
be parts -of-speech (POS) tagging — identifying nouns, verbs, noun phrases, 
etc. The results would be a thesauri or ontologies better than those"
produced without ML techniques (and produce quickly).
"265 Controlled vocabularies, and similar, are still important even with free text 
search and search by meaning. They can provide an interface, or 
commonality, between different documents or collections of documents.  
 
9.8 Indexing and Automatic Indexing"
"A simple example of an index that we are all familiar with is that of an 
ordinary back -of-the-book index. The index itself consists of a list of entries . 
The entries are composed of headings  and locators. For our purposes, we can"
"assume the headings to constitute a (controlled vocabulary) thesaurus — so 
there might be sub -headings and sub -sub-headings, etc. in a hierarchical 
arrangement.  Each entry is a pair of a  thesaurus term and one or more"
"locators. In the case of a book, a locator would just be a page number. So, the 
index itself has an easily navigable structure — the top -level terms are in 
alphabetical or filing order. But the book, in so far as its individual fine -"
"grained topics are concerned, is a jumbled disordered mess. Were a User to be 
interested in finding out where the ship Pequod is discussed, described, or 
alluded to, in the novel Moby Dick, a proper index would make this task trivial"
"whereas doing it by looking through the book would be a considerable 
challenge. An index provides simple, readily understandable, access to points 
of interest in an information mess.  
 
As to creating an index in the first place , Bella Haas Weinberg writes (mainly"
"under the assumption that the indexer is a human being) : 
 
An indexer must be something of a prophet — envisioning the 
concepts likely to be sought by users of a document, expressing 
those concepts in terms likely to be sought by users, and providing"
cross -references from synonyms and alternative spellings as well
"266 as links to related terms to assist users in finding all the 
information that is relevant to their topics of interest  (Weinberg, 
2009) . 
 
Notice here that Weinberg refers to indexing in terms of concepts. It is 
possible to do derived  indexing, which uses only terms that appear in the"
"document or documents, or to do assigned  indexing, which uses the 
concepts  i.e it is indexing by meaning . Assigned indexing is superior ('  …to 
assist users in finding all the information that is relevant to their topics of"
"interest  '). Assigned indexing addresses the problem of synonyms and 
homographs, and also those very difficult cases where a concept is alluded 
to but not referred to explicitly. Derived indexing is pretty well trivial from 
a computing point of view (it is string in string searching). Assigned"
"indexing is another matter entirely as it seems to require 'understanding' 
the material.  
 
'Good indexing permits good retrieval’ . 
 
As the quote reveals, Weinberg sees the main intellectual challenge of 
indexing as being that of creating the controlled vocabulary thesaurus of"
"headings that is to be employed . The secondary problem of scanning the 
text to catch all the locations for the locators in the entries is relatively 
routine and easy.  
 
Indexes can be surprisingly sophisticated.  Indexes typically work on"
"structured sources  or across collections of sources . So, for example, an 
index for a book might tell you that material relating to the concept  
'machine' appears of page 37 and page 39. This is to conceive of the book as"
"267 being a structured source , with pages which are themselves sources , and 
the index is finding the component sources . Or, as another example, an 
index across a digital collection of full text sources  might inform you that a"
"particular topic is to be found within a few specific sources . In sum, ind exes 
enable access to works within works: articles within periodicals; short 
stories, poems, or essays within a larger work; or individual papers from a 
conference."
"Cumulative indexes  would use the same thesaurus to index across several 
different sources; for example, across all the monthly issues for a year's 
publication of a journal.  
 
AI/NLP  can improve  traditional indexing.  It can do standard indexing"
"faster than human indexers and the result can be of higher quality. It can 
produce a headings thesaurus without difficulty. Then fleshing out the 
entries with the locators is essentially trivial. Many of the actual cases of 
indexing will use a n antecedently  provided thesaurus. For example,"
"indexing medical journals would do this. Th e complete task  then comes 
under the heading of automatic indexing . Another advantage to AI/NLP 
indexing is that it can provide locators to outside sources, for example to 
other books or texts with references to Pequod  (the whaling ship in  Moby"
Dick) . Such pathways to wider resources are valuable for researchers.
"268 9.9 Abstracts, Extracts, Key Phrases, Keywords, and 
Summaries  
 
Abstracts usually either give the content in a shortened, sometimes 
structured, form, or point to or indicate what treasures are to be found in 
the work or works but without actually providing those nuggets. Single"
"sources can be abstracted, so too can multiple sources (as might be the case 
with abstracting the news from several different news sources into one 
abstract or abstracting many reviews of a source to produce an overall 
viewpoint )."
"Prior to the 1950s abstracting was always done by humans. But with the 
research of Luhn and others attention was given to the possibilities of 
automatic abstraction (Luhn 1958) . This work is a sub -area of 
Computational Linguistics. The techniques were certainly computational,"
"and some may be classified as AI, but, until very recently there was not 
really ML  involved . Automation is important because there are many more 
documents that would benefit from being abstracted than there are human 
abstracters to do the work."
"Abstracting would generally be either abstractive summaries or extractive 
summaries. The former tries to understand what is in the source and then 
paraphrasing it in a shortened form. The latter extracts and condenses what"
"is there, without necessarily understanding it, using statistical features and 
‘signposts’. To illustrate the typical statistical features that might be used. 
Material at the beginning and end of the entire text is important, material"
"at the beginnings and ends of paragraphs is important,  words (other than"
"269 stopwords (i.e. ‘the’, ‘a’, etc.) that appear frequently are important and so 
on. 
 
Researchers in this area do have techniques for assessing their results. In 
some form or other, these are normally comparisons against abstracts that"
"have been produced by humans. (See, for example, ‘Rouge’ i.e.  Recall -
Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation  (Lin 2004) .) It seems fair to 
say, as of 2021, the computational abstracts are not of higher quality than 
human authored ones. However, the software approach is thousands,"
"millions, or billions of times faster than humans. So, for example, it can 
produce abstracts real time e.g. it can abstract news sources as fast as those 
sources are conveying news. There is Machine Learning in much of recent"
"research on abstracting, but usually the ML is not used on its own but 
rather is augmented by tried and true methods (Widyassari et al. 2020) . 
There does not seem to be any technical problem as to why ML abstracting 
would just not get better and better. Likely NLP abstracting will be the"
"equal of, or superior to, human abstracting sometime in the early 2020s.  
 
Producing Key Phrases or Keywords is a similar, but simpler, problem to 
abstracting. If it is desired that the ‘Keys’ appear verbatim in the text, then"
"challenge is like extractive summary. Often, though, it would be preferred 
that Keywords come from a Controlled Vocabulary (CV). If so, maybe none 
of a text’s Keywords actually appear in the text. For example, the non -CV 
word ‘car’ might be in the text but the preferred CV Keyword term"
"‘automobile’ is not. ML is a possibility both with extractive Keywords an d 
with pure abstractive Keywords (e.g. Controlled Vocabulary Keywords). 
Extractive Keywords can be approached with unsupervised learning"
"270 (Mishra 2021) . This is a well -worked research area, not because the 
researchers are trying to help journal editors with lead -in Keywords for 
articles. Rather, the computational linguists want to extract important 
words for further processing. Abstractive Keywords (e.g. Controlled"
"Vocabulary Keywords) could be set up as a supervised Classification 
problem. The CV would be the classes or categories, and the classification 
would note perhaps the best 8 terms that apply. These lead -ins specifically 
would help journal editors, and researchers and librarians looking for"
"documents.  
 
A summary of content would usually be longer and more detailed than an 
abstract of the same content. Summaries often rephrase the content. 
Otherwise, abstracts and summaries  would be fairly similar.  Summaries, or 
abstracts, may have specific features. They may have Named Entity"
"Recognition . If the source is fiction, a summary may contain a plot outline 
or an identification of the plot type or story type.  Summarizing across 
multiple sources is also a form of synthesizing or aggregating those 
sources — summarizing across ten different articles on linear algebra"
"amounts to one way of aggregating those articles.  
 
How might these techniques help librarianship?  Summarizing documents 
may directly help Users (which may be human, or software) to find relevant 
content.  Summaries may improve information access tools, such as catalogs"
"and databases,  by becoming part of the metadata that is used to 
characterize information resources . One of the first books written by 
machine learning — Lithium -ion Batteries — is a collective summary of 200 
research articles  (Writer 2019) ."
"271   
9.10 Text Mining  and Question Answering  
 
Text mining can extrac t potentially useful information from text such as 
information regarding named entities, topics, classification features, 
genres, summaries, and sentiments of reviews — techniques that have been"
"described in this chapter . Any or all of these types of information may help 
a User narrow an information search and thus make it more precise.  
 
Text mining is often used in conjunction with other techniques for example, 
with sentiment analysis, or with recommendation systems."
"Later we will look at Undiscovered Public Knowledge (UPK) — that is 
knowledge that is in books or libraries that is 'undiscovered'. Text mining 
helps discover it.  
 
9.11 Machine Translation  
 
This involves automatically translating text from one language to another."
"The value of this to librarianship is obvious.  These topics and techniques 
are discussed elsewhere in this book.  
 
9.12 Evidence  
 
It has been asserted in this chapter that NLP is capable of doing this -and-
that. Researchers in this field do have evidence. There are benchmarks that"
"272 the systems are tested on  (NLP -progress 2022) . In fact, there is usually 
competition between the systems on how well they can do on the 
benchmarks. There are questions over the accuracy of the results of 
generative systems. There are difficulties with the prompts: with ‘noise’,"
"context, and ambiguity. Also, an LLM will not usually predict the same 
thing twice — thanks to the probabilities. So, it not clear just what an 
accurate result is where an LLM is given the task of writing a paragraph in"
"the style of Jane Austen.  [There is further discussion in Section 4.8.1  on 
hallucinations.]  
 
9.13 This Is Not Magic  
 
Several  of the topics and techniques mentioned in this chapter might sound 
a bit esoteric. But , actually , the means  for a programmer (or library"
"technical services department ) to produce suitable software is simple and 
has been readily available  since  2023. The best approach would be to use 
Large Language Models (LLMs) , and to use one that has a public 
Application Programming Interface (API). For example, Open AI's GPT -4"
"does so. Then a programming environment like LangChain can be used to 
'program' or configure LLMs from their APIs. The resulting program to 
perform one of the tasks mentioned in this chapter might have about 50 
lines of code in it. A professional programmer might write 7 lines of code a"
"day (when, as a pre -requisite, they have to think about and research the 
problem). So, the first program might take a week to produce. But the 
second and subsequent ones could be written in about an hour each.  Go to 
it!"
"273 Since  November 2023, there are  have been  even faster and easier ways of 
doing some of these projects. OpenAI has pro duce the building framework 
‘GPTs’ which is a simple no -coding -required system for personalizing the"
"multimodal GPT -4 Turbo to various NLP and LMM tasks (OpenAI 2023d) . 
Neither programmers nor LangChain are needed for this . 
 
9.14 Text Processing and Laws  
 
Needless to say, there  are laws and contracts that might restrict the"
"unfettered use of NLP on document collections such as libraries. Further, 
librarians and  their institutions can be intimidated at the mere pro spect of 
legal cases  (like the rest of us ). The laws concern primarily copyright and"
"intellectual property, and they differ from country to country. This area is 
complex. A good initial source is H. Andr és Izquierdo ’s 20 Artificial 
Intelligence and Text and Data Mining: Future Rules for Libraries?  
(Izquierdo 2022) ."
"At a rough handwaving level, we might say this. Copyright concerns the 
expression of ideas , not the ideas themselves . So, when Einstein wrote the 
theory of relativity, his actual words might have had some copyright 
protections but the theory of relativity itself did not. So, when NLP"
"abstracts, or paraphrases, or summarizes, or text -data -mines , documents 
or collections  in its own words , it might be that there would be no 
copyright concerns. In contrast, extractive abstracts or summari es, or 
quotation of passages verbatim , etc. might be problematic. Additionally,"
"many copyright laws have exceptions for ‘fair use’ which might include use 
for research, teaching, and non -commercial uses."
"274  
Contracts are another matter.  The owners of the intellectual property can 
seek whatever contracts they wish. Librarians, or their institutions, can 
agree, or not agree, to these contracts, as they wish. Some advice: librarians"
"should agree only to contracts that are permissive on text -data -mining and 
other NLP techniques.  
 
A further problem or issue is that more than a few times the owners of the 
intellectual property are unknown or untraceable (as might be the case with 
some historical documents)."

"275 Chapter 10: What are the Opportunities for 
Librarians?  
 
10.1 Introduction  
 
In 1989, Edward Feigenbaum ('the father of expert systems')  observed  in 
the paper Toward the library of the future  that the problem with the then"
"extant libraries was that the books did not talk to each other  (Feigenbaum 
1989) . He continued : 
 
… imagine the library as an active intelligent  knowledge server. It 
stores knowledge of the disciplines in complex knowledge 
structures, perhaps in a knowledge  representation formalism yet"
"to be discovered or invented. It can reason with this knowledge to 
satisfy the needs of its users. These needs are expressed naturally 
with fluid discourse. The system can, of course, retrieve and 
exhibit. That is, it can act as  an electronic  textbook,  but it  can also"
"collect relevant information, it can summarize, it can pursue 
relationships. It acts as a consultant on specific problems, offering 
advice on particular  solutions, justifying those solutions with 
citations, or  with  a fabric  of general  reasoning. If  the user  can"
"suggest a solution or an hypothesis, it can check it. It can even 
suggest extensions, or it can criticise the user's viewpoint with a 
detailed rationale of its agreement or disagreement. It pursues 
relational paths of associations, to suggest to the user previously"
"unseen connections. Collaborating with the user, it uses its 
processes of association and analogizing to brainstorm for remote 
or novel concepts. With more autonomy, but with some guidance 
from the user, it uses criteria of 'interestingness' to discover new"
"concepts, new methods, new theories, new measurements  
(Feigenbaum 1989, 122) ."
"276 Feigenbaum is addressing a certain kind of library here, what would be 
called an 'academic library' or a 'research library' (and those categories  
might include university libraries and medical libraries).  
 
There are many types of libraries, including:  
 
Academic libraries"
"Children's libraries  
Digital libraries  
Medical libraries  
National libraries  
Public lending libraries  
Reference libraries  
Research libraries  
Special libraries  
University libraries  
 
[See (Wikipedia 2023i; American Library Association 2007)  for a"
"description of some of these and an explanation of their functions.] The 
librarianship activities associated with these are many and varied, and 
there are also other librarianship activities not connected with institutions"
"specifically of these types. For our purposes, as a practicality, we have to 
restrict our gaze. For the most part, we will be looking at machine learning 
in connection with scholarship, research, and advancing knowledge (i.e."
"with Feigenbaum's approach of relating AI to the notion of a library as a 
knowledge server). This means that our main focus will be academic 
libraries (including university libraries), medical libraries, and research 
libraries. We also often consider librarianship in general. There may be the"
"odd remark on machine learning in other kinds of libraries (as examples, 
that humanoid robots may be valuable for children's story times  in public 
libraries  (Nguyen 2020) , and that handwriting recognition may be valuable"
"277 for the Vatican Archive, which is a special library  (D. Firmani et al. 2018) ), 
but coverage of these areas is going to be thin. Sorry.  
 
There is the idea of collections as data and data as collections, with 
librarianship as an interface (see, for example, (Padilla et al. 2019) )."
"Standard libraries can be though t of as collections — collections of texts, 
documents, and books, and also, perhaps, of means of access to the same or 
similar items. Some, or many, of these collections, or parts of collections,"
"will be born digital, or become digitized, and will be available to computers, 
artificial intelligence, and ML. Thus, there is the notion of collections as 
computer data. But also, we now live in the age of big data. Huge amounts"
"of data are being accumulated by researchers, governments, social agencies, 
and commercial interests. Many subsets of this big data are collections. 
They are libraries. They are subject to the ordinary concerns of 
librarianship, such as: organization, preservation, storage, access, retrieval,"
"and stewardship. So, there are collections as data and data as collections, 
with librarianship as an interface . For example, researchers in astrophysics, 
with their telescopes, radio dishes, and myriad of other instruments,"
"produce data repositories that stand in need of librarianship. Then, still in 
their day job s, these researchers read research papers in journals and 
collections. Provision of these also needs librarianship.  
 
There is an abundance of modern digitized, or born -digital, resources, and"
"this abundance is growing rapidly all the time. There is a plethora of 
sources spewing ever more 0s and 1s. Facing up to this on behalf of 
librarianship are a relatively small number of expert human librarians. 
There is an order of magnitude difference here — the potentially valuable"
"278 tasks, and the collection sizes, far outweigh the capabilities of a team of 
human librarians, even if the number of librarians were to be increased a 
million -fold. As an example, which is becoming slightly dated, there is the"
"MeSH indexing of biomedical publications (about 7000 articles a day were 
being  indexed). Yuqing Mao and Zhiyong Lu wr ote: 
 
MeSH indexing is the task of assigning relevant MeSH  terms 
based on a manual reading of scholarly publications by human"
"indexers. The task is highly important for improving literature 
retrieval and many other scientific investigations in biomedical 
research. Unfortunately, given its manual nature, the process of 
MeSH indexing is both time -consuming (new articles are not"
"immediately indexed until 2 or 3  months later) and costly 
(approximately ten dollars per article)  (Mao and Lu 2017) . 
 
There is a general point to be made here (the same general point as will be 
made elsewhere over and over). Computers have a 24x7 work ethic, and ML"
"can often supply expertise. Many areas have been automated already. But 
this is an ongoing and expanding process. Of course, human librarians use 
many tools to increase their capabilities viz -a-viz librarianship, but we are 
moving into an age where the ML systems on their own can produce"
"excellent performance  (maybe even superior performance ). 
 
Librarians already work with many systems that have connections to AI and 
ML. Here is one way to classify librarians working in AI or ML in roles: -  
 
Librarians can be seen as  
 
• Synergists  
• Sentries"
"279 • Educators  
• Managers  
• Astronauts  
 
Individual librarians may fulfil different roles on different occasions, or, 
indeed, be working in different roles at the same time.  
 
10.2 Librarians as Synergists  
 
Librarians have several thousand years of experience of working with"
"recorded information. They are ideal partners to AI to bring out the best in 
this information with all its aspects, challenges, and facets. And, on the 
other side of this, there are many AI and ML technologies that have the"
"potential to improve librarianship. There is an opportunity for synergy or 
symbiosis.  
 
We will introduce a few sample possibilities here and expand on the topic 
later in a dedicated chapter.  
 
Synergists:  
 
• Intellectual Freedom . AI, ML, and librarianship have potential to"
"enhance Intellectual Freedom, both the expression of free speech and 
access to it: as examples, Optical Character Recognition leading into 
machine reading and speaking of text,  and, separately,  machine 
translation of text leading to recorded text being available in many"
"280 languages (Knox 2023) . Machine learning is now expanding these 
possibilities to hundreds, even thousands, of languages.  
• Smartphones . Man y young, and not so young, people use 
smartphones as their main means of access to information. This"
"opens an obvious invitation to librarians to bring  libraries and 
librarianship to patrons via smartphones  (e.g. via a bundle of voice 
and sound, static and dynamic text, and images and video) . This 
might involve AI, ML and chatbots.  
• Improving Intermediation Between Users and Information"
"Resou rces.  As examples: search engines rank their returns, from 
more important to less important, and, separately, there are 
'recommender' systems which can recommend other resources 
similar to ones favored by the User. Pure librarianship does not have"
"either  ranking or recommending  in any developed form. Even the 
computer, or AI systems, versions have not yet realized their 
potential.  
• Improving Traditional Cataloging, Classification , and 
Retrieval Tools. Standard point: t here are, and always will be,"
"fewer expert human catalogers than are required to address the 
increasing flood of resources. Computers and ML can redress this. 
Also, NLP can perform valuable librarianship tasks that are not 
practical for humans. For example, it could look at a million"
"publications and identify, de novo , what subjects, topics, or genres 
each might be labeled with. 'De novo' here means 'without using any 
antecedent classification schemes'.  
• Chatbots. Chatbots have the potential to do most of the current"
"tasks where librarians interact  with patrons, either  synchronousl y or"
"281 asynchronously  (e.g., in person, on the telephone, on video calling, by 
messaging, etc.).  
• Release, Produce, Curate , or Inspire the Production of,  
Training Data. Librarians already have metadata on the contents of 
libraries — metadata which, for the most part, is accurate and labeled"
"well. Also, librarians are well placed to use handwriting recognition 
on archives of historical documents.  Developing handwriting 
recognition for these will require the production of data (most likely 
labeled samples).  
• Social Epistemology . The promotion of social knowledge — social"
"epistemology — is a vital function of librarianship (Egan and Shera 
1952; Fallis 2002; 2006; Fuller 1988; Goldman 1999) . It is a function 
that librarians have been doing for millennia . Social epistemology  
faces problems aplenty nowadays with disinformation,"
"misinformation, fake news, deep fakes and the like (Meszaros and 
Goodsett 2022) . Librarians, in conjunction with the tools of ML, are 
well placed to take on the challenges.  There is now the opportunity, 
and the need, to do more."
"• Images . There are libraries and collections of images (for example, 
the Center for Creative Photography in the University of Arizona 
(CCP 2020) ). Also, many publications contain images, figures, and 
diagrams. Attaching metadata to the images, and then finding the"
"desired images , has always proved difficult. But now ML is allowing it 
to become possible for standard librarianship operations to be 
performed on media like images.  For example, you can now enter an 
image itself, or a verbal description of an image, as search 'terms', and"
a suitable search system will be able to find all similar or relevant
"282 images within a  document or  collection. These possibilities would be 
enriched by insight  from librarians . Images  are getting to be 
addressed reasonably well by ML.  
 
Jason Griffey asks an interesting question in connect ion with synergy. He"
"introduces it by way of recommender systems and improving personal 
intermediation : 
 
… the system trains itself from the user’s behavior.  
One can easily imagine systems built to do this sort of automation 
work for researchers and students. As AI systems continue to be"
"easier to implement, having a system local to your device that 
learns your preferences, your interests, and your needs will be 
commonplace. Researchers and students will have AI systems that 
find sources for them, summarize them, help them build"
"bibliographies, and more. Over time, these systems will become 
irreplaceable archives of the learning and thinking history of 
individuals, a sort of universal diary of their activities. Now, 
imagine for a moment that this sort of system exists and is used by"
"most learners. Who would you prefer be the developer of such a 
system: a large corporation like Facebook, or a collaborative 
effort by educational institutions and libraries?  (Griffey 2019, 27)  
[Italics added.]  
 
We will see an example later of ‘a collaborative effort by educational"
"institutions and libraries’ — that by Kent Fitch in the Section 10.2.4 (Fitch 
2023) . Another example should perhaps be mentioned, that o f Kaushik Roy 
and fellow authors using retrieval -augmented generation (RAG) (Roy et al. 
2023)"
"283 10.3 Librarians as Sentries  
 
Unfortunately, many of the  potential benefits  of ML and librarianship  have 
concomitant downsides. Here the librarians can be sentries.  To anticipate , 
the challenge is that advances in ML have been so rapid that suitable ethic al"
"systems, laws, and policies either do not exist o r are out of date.  Librarians 
can help create these.  
 
Sentries , here are some examples:  
 
• Copyright and intellectual property  Intellectual Freedom  
interacts with restrictions of privacy, intellectual property, state"
"secrets, and so forth. These considerations required careful 
management (and librarians have plenty of experience with, for 
example, intellectual property, fair use, and licensing).  
• Bias management There  are various kinds of bias that can arise in"
"connection with ML and information provision. Librarians do have 
experience in managing bias. For example, they do it in collection 
development, collection description, instruction, and research support  
(Padilla 2019) .  
• Monitoring techniques to  improve search Methods associated"
"with personalization and recommendation impinge on privacy (by, 
for example, monitoring Users' behavior  to create the 
personalization ). Filtering has had a bad reputation within 
librarianship (primarily due to misadventures involving filtering"
"schools' access to websites). But , when doing a search, providing"
"284 recommendations is filtering. Then filtering can lead to information 
silos or bubbles.  There are problems here to be addressed.  
• Intellectual freedom  This needs management. The collections and 
services should presumably give patrons access to a wide range of"
"diverse and thought -provoking materials, while also protecting them 
from potentially harmful or offensive or false or ungrounded or 
obviously crazy content . But how to do this is a question: one person's 
crazy might be another's happy territory. And the idea of 'protecting'"
"introduces  paternalism which should not be required for fully 
functional adults.  Machine learning systems could very easily work in 
a paternalist way.  
• Inadvertent censorship  The properties and behaviors of advanced 
machine learning systems for example, those built from foundation"
"models, are usually not fully known. Caution is needed to ensure, for 
example, that there is not accidental censo rship.  
 
10.4 Librarians as Educators  
 
Librarians have a role as educators.  
 
Educators:  
 
• Information Literacy  Librarians have always been the standard"
"bearers for information literacy. But Artificial Intelligence (AI) has 
changed what information literacy can be. There is ongoing 
development of new tools for interacting with information , for 
example, personalized search. AI or ML , as research disciplines or"
"285 commercial enterprise s, devote little or no attention to information 
literacy  itself  (except in so far as the AI or ML can be a part of any 
educational course or teaching on any discipline or topic).  
• Data Literacy , Data Science Fluency,  and AI Literacy  There"
"are other forms of information related literacy that are becoming 
important (Ridley and Pawlick -Potts 2021a; Digital2030 2022; Druga 
et al. 2019a; Carlson and Johnston 2015; Padilla 2019) . For example, 
research scientists are often required to have data management plans."
"They are producers of data, and they need to know how to manage it 
for the benefit of other researchers and the world at large. Librarians 
can help  the researchers directly and also play a role in educating 
student researchers in the management of data.  Another example is"
"that AI and ML have expanded the realm of Automated Decision 
Making (ADM) (e.g. the making  mortgage loans). An informed 
citizenry should be alert to the strengths and weakness of ADM.  
• More Intelligent Consumer s of Information . This includes 
both p atrons and library staff."
"• Better Informed Citizens  Outside of actual information literacy, 
there are considerations of helping citizens understand ML and 
computational aspects of the world they live in (and , in the case of 
living in the USA,  how some other countries are approaching it). As"
"examples, there is the Canadian Algorithm and Data Literacy Project  
(Digital2030 2022) , and there is the European Generalized Data 
Protection Regulation  (Wolford 2018) ."
"286 10.5 Librarians as Managers  
 
At a perhaps a more day-to-day level, librarians run libraries, both physical 
and digital. Computer assisted automation is widely used and is of obvious 
benefit. Book acquisitions, cataloging, serials control, and circulation,"
"information retrieval and dissemination, interlibrary loan, cooperative 
acquisition and cataloging have been automated in the library 
(Lakshmikant and Vishnu, 2008).  
 
AI can improve the running of libraries.  We are trying to steer clear of plain"
"automation in this text. We will try to restrict ourselves to cases where the 
software uses or simulate artificial intelligence.  
 
Managers : 
 
• Workflow  and Improving Service  ML has the potential to 
enhance productivity and efficiency in libraries. Many the"
"components here have been mentioned already: ML cataloging, 
personalization, recommender systems, better search, chatbots for 
customer service, predictive analysis for collection management, user 
behavior analysis to improve service, and digitizing special 
collections."
"• Optimize the Use of Space  (and, Indeed, Other Resources) 
ML is good at optimization problems.  
• Robots  To put books back on the shel ves (!), to do s tory-telling , to 
meet and greet, and more ."
"287 • Mimic Librarian Experts ' Behaviors  To support decision 
making and management . 
 
10.6 Librarians as Astronauts  
 
Astronauts , well, who knows? But  most  of human knowledge  is in libraries . 
ML will allow exploration here of a kind that has never been done before.  
 
Astronauts:"
"• Creating Knowledge . There is d eep text extraction and synthesis 
from materials already in libraries . More than a few university 
researchers conduct their research using only their initiative and the 
contents of libraries. ML will be able to do this (and render the faculty"
"researcher redundant in this regard).  
• Drawing Out Knowledge . There are many special collections that 
have not been digitized and transcribed (and, perhaps, for some  of 
those that approach might not be acceptable). But processed"
"collections — with indexes, for example — might provide access to 
treasures.  
• Moonshots ?  Who Knows What They Might Be?"

11.1 Intellectual Freedom  
 
Intellectual freedom is the right, and perhaps the ability, to access or 
disseminate any information that the person wishes. Now, there are many"
"qualifications here, obviously, such as those concerning privacy, intellectual 
property, offensive materials, state secrets, etc. Let us build in the 
restrictions and consider only those cases where there is a right to freedom"
"of access or to freedom of speech (i.e. to freedom of dissemination). Then 
let us concentrate on the ability to exercise our rights in those  cases. It is 
reasonably common in rights discussions to distinguish privilege  rights"
"from claim  rights (Wenar 2021) . A person has a privilege right to do X, if, 
and only if, they do not have a duty not to do X. So, a mature person 
presumably has a privilege right to read, say, Huckleberry Finn, and that"
"right exists because they do not have a duty not to read it. Additionally, a 
privilege right is a freedom, to the right’s holder, which does not impose 
any obligations on any other party to facilitate that right. If you have a"
"privilege right of freedom of access to some form of information, you may 
access that informati on, but no one is obliged to give you practical help to 
do so. Claim rights, in contrast, impose a duty on some person or entity to"
"actively assist a person to exercise the right. For example, some folk might 
not be able to afford to buy, or simply might not wish to own, some of the 
books that they are interested to read — in these cases, libraries, perhaps"
"public libraries, can facilitate a claim right of access to those resources. In 
contrast, book sellers or bookstores are not subject to a claim right of access"
"291 (in the absence of purchase, or similar, from the would -be reader) — they do 
not have a duty to provide access.  
 
Libraries, especially public libraries, aim to satisfy claim rights of access. 
Some also may provide a physical public space for meetings. This would be"
"assisting with disseminations, perhaps even assisting with claim rights 
concerning dissemination. Libraries, or librarians, also often  are active in 
opposing ‘banned books’. Third parties might want copies of, say, 
Huckleberry Finn, removed from a library. What is happening here is that"
"the third parties are partially denying the claim rights of others (and 
possibly also denying the privilege rights of others). Librarians are 
defending these rights. So, librarians help meet some intellectual freedom 
rights and defend others (Garnar and Magi 2021; American Library"
"Association 2008) . 
 
How machine ML help with this? The short answer is : librarians need to 
provide direction as to what they wish their policies to be by way of 
addressing rights of access and dissemination. In the past they have"
"provided such direction, and they continue to do so in the present. But the 
landscape as to what is possible is changing rapidly, so policies require 
ongoing attention. ML cannot really help with what the policies should be. 
But once the policies are in place, ML can certainly help with the"
implementation. Here are some details.
"292 11.1.1 Text Recognition  
 
Text recognition has been an absolute triumph in enabling people with 
visual challenges, or reading difficulties, to access written and printed 
materials. In a library setting, text is understood to be recordings that are"
"written, or printed, or reproduced, pieces of language that can convey 
meaning. These recordings can range from handwritten documents to 
professionally printed books, from documents thousands of years old to 
those from the present day, from originals to photocopies of photos of"
"photos pasted into a painting collage. The recordings have a form, and 
mostly they have meaning. Text recognition is trying to capture the 
structured form of the text as computer input, and not the deeper meaning. 
For example, consider the text ‘Now, I am angry.’ What text recognition"
"needs to be able to do is to pick the letters in sequence i.e. ‘N’, ‘o’, ‘w’, etc., 
to pick the words (likely from the separators such as the blank spaces), to 
pick the sentences (likely from the upper -case letters, periods, and"
"punctuation), etc. It does not need to be able to grasp what the text means 
(e.g. what or who the indexicals like ‘I’ and ‘now’ refer to, or what the word 
'angry' means).  
 
Two further points should perhaps be made. Text recognition's main line of"
"business is not that of helping people who are visually challenged, rather it 
is that of helping large corporations and institutions convert their paper 
records and data into digital form. Assisting the visually challenged is"
"happy side effect of that enterprise. Second, complexities arise with OCR 
over whether the source documents are monolingual or multilingual, and"
"293 consequently the various alphabets, orthographies, and grammars that 
might be in use (see, for example, (Alpert -Abrams 2016) ). It is possible for 
target sources to be multilingual. They would constitute additional 
challenges. Multilingual sources are not common. But they certainly can"
"appear in older materials where there might be a mix of a scholarly 
language (e.g. Latin) with a vernacular (e.g. Italian, French, English.) 
Consider an older handwritten text, written in several languages, and which 
uses 'loan words' (i.e.  uses or quotes words from other languages)."
"Adequate OCR here might require relevant outside knowledge (for 
example, of the provenance, and cultural background, of the document).  
 
As mentioned earlier, most modern publications exist at some point in 
digital form. If there is access to that digitization, text recognition is not"
"needed. So, generally speaking, text recognition for library purposes is not 
as important now, 2023, for modern materials, as it was, say, for materials 
produced prior to the 1980s. Also, the use of a variety of fonts and printing"
"styles, which make text recognition harder, are a modern development. 
That help is to some degree offset with other problems with older materials 
such as  difficulties with ink fading, poor printing, deterioration of the 
paper, etc. Nevertheless , the main problem areas for text recognition in"
"libraries are older printed works, where the publishers have a restricted 
choice of font palette, and, separately, handwritten documents. Generally, 
printers are trying to print works in a form that the readers can read. They"
"are not trying to distort letters left and right, or larger and smaller in way 
that would challenger readers (or, indeed, OCR  systems). The original OCR 
systems of the 1970s would not have been ML systems, but nowadays they"
"294 certainly would be. For a discussion of OCR, we can consider just neural 
nets.  
 
Conceptually, text recognition takes place in two phases: the optical 
character recognition (OCR), and the discernment of structure within the"
"stream of characters. From an ML point of view, OCR is an example of a 
supervised classification problem. First there is a classification system, 
which is a collection of classes, or categories, or sets — in this case, that is"
"going to be an alphabet of characters e.g. ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’ etc. Then there will be 
the characters, or character instances, themselves which will start 
computational life as visual disturbances, marks, blobs, etc. on paper or 
some other medium. Likely they will then become patterns of pixels in"
"electronic images that the algorithms can address. Processing will 
individuate these into characters -of-interest, then ML will classify each one 
of these as being an ‘a’ or a ‘z’ or a ‘j’ or a space or other character."
"It sounds simple, but it is not. There are issues and challenges. Let us start 
with the classification system. There are about a dozen writing systems, and 
hundreds of alphabets (Ager 2023) . There is the need to pick one or several"
"here. Which one is chosen presumably depends on the purposes at hand. If 
a library has primarily English sources, presumably the English Alphabet 
would be a good start. This is not in any way to insult or denigrate, for 
example, Japanese and Hiragana. There are two points to be made here."
"Classification systems usually carry baggage with them. They have 
assumptions and consequences that extend further than the classification 
systems themselves. (See, for example, (Bowker and Star 2000; S. Berman 
2000) .) An OCR implementation might be able to recognize English"
"295 characters but not Hiragana — and that might matter for those who can or 
cannot benefit from the specific OCR. Second, the choice of classification 
system or systems might involve a wide range of constituents, not just 
programmers or AI researchers imposing their will. The patron, user,"
"librarian, research challenge, and infrastructure and legal framework, also 
can provide input.  
 
Then Supervised ML OCR is going to be taught, or learn, how to classify 
characters. It will be supplied with a training set , which will be a"
"reasonable sample of letters and the right labels or classifications of what 
they are. The training set might run to 100,000 labeled characters. The 
overall technique is an optical one, so it is the features of the sample letters"
"that can be detected optically that will be the input (e.g. size, shape, color, 
grid arrangement of component dots or pixels, etc.). Then the program will 
attempt to correlate combinations (i.e. vectors) of these with the correct"
"classification e.g. that a particular sample token character is an ‘a’. More 
than likely, the program will make many mistakes initially. But either the 
programmers, or the program itself, will tune various parameters (e.g. 
weights on the components of the vectors) to improve the classification"
"until it reaches an acceptable level of performance. Typically here , the 
neural net would have 5 -6 layers and hundreds to thousands of neurons in 
the layers.  
 
The training set needs to be adequate for the task. For example, if the letter"
"‘j’ does not appear in the training set, it is unreasonable to expect the ML 
program to classify js correctly. Even if js appear, there needs to be enough 
of them in the various fonts and scripts (cursive or not, monospaced or"
"296 proportional, etc.) for the program to be able to learn what is correct and 
what is not. OCR, i.e. the task of recognizing the actual individual 
characters, would not usually be an end in itself. Rather, the interest would"
"be in the words that those characters form, or, more generally, the text.  
 
If the OCR, or Text Recognition, application has access to a wider context, 
that can improve its performance. For example, if the ML is recognizing 
entire words from their component characters, and separators, then the"
"first letter of ‘On’ is going to be the letter upper case ‘O’ and not the 
numeric letter zero ‘0’ — the number zero makes no sense in that context.  
 
Let us assume going forward that there is ML that can take an input of"
"images (i.e. a page of visual representations of characters, an ordinary book 
of words, etc.) and produce as output text. Now, text, in a computer science 
sense, consists of ‘strings’ or sequences of characters, and, once in that"
"form, they can be processed in a variety of ways. For example, they can be 
searched, or edited (cut, copied, pasted, transformed etc.). To give a 
practical example of the advantage of strings over raw images, finding the 
word ‘covid’ in some (computer science) digital text is near trivial for a"
"computer program. Contrast that with the following. Imagine a photocopy , 
or photograph, of the front page of a newspaper, and the problem finding 
whether there is a sub -image in it that might be construed as an image of"
"the word ‘covid’ — i.e. does the word ‘covid’ appear on the front page of the 
newspaper?  That is a much harder problem. (You know that, of course, 
from the online Captcha tests that are used to detect whether you are a 
human or a program or ‘bot’ pretending to be a human (Wikipedia 2023a) .)"
"297 OCR for modern printed monolingual text is near perfect. There is a 
qualification here. OCR needs training data. There are about 7,000 
languages in the world, and about half of these have writing systems. Of 
those 3000 or so with writing systems, quite a lot less have enough printed"
"text to be suitable training data. Current OCR systems can read about 200 
different languages. There will be more languages than that with suitable 
training texts, but there also needs to be either commercial or intellectual 
incentives for the relevant OCR research to be done."
"As the Text Recognition systems have improved, their compass has been 
extended to include handwriting recognition i.e. transcribing handwriting 
to the 0s and 1s of computer text. This is very important. To give an 
example. The Vatican Apostolic Archives (the Vatican Secret Archives)"
"contain hundreds of thousands of documents going back many centuries 
(D. Firmani et al. 2018; Wikipedia 2022f) . Most of these documents are 
handwritten, and certainly more than a few of them are of great 
significance . As example s, one is from Henry VIII to the Pope requesting a"
"marriage annulment , there is the Catholic Church’s 1521 excommunication 
of Martin Luther, and there are notes from the trial of Galileo . 
 
Transcribing handwriting is of a level of difficulty harder than transcribing 
printed text. There are different cases to be considered. There is personal"
"handwriting to be transcribed ‘online’ (i.e. as it is being written, real -time, 
perhaps onto a smartphone or tablet). For example, a User may handwrite 
entry into a text -messaging app. There is purely personal , or official,"
"handwriting to be transcribed ‘offline’ (i.e. from a recorded document after 
it has been written). Transcribing online is easier than offline because"
"298 information is available on the pen strokes, their sequence and timings. 
This information helps, for example, with segmentation: with identifying 
the lines, the words, and the characters. There can be real -time 
transcription with the characteristics of offline, for example, so -called"
"scene -in-scene transcription. For example, driverless cars may have the 
need to ‘read’ road signs and other textual information that they are 
‘seeing’. There may also be some value in the ability of a driverless car to 
read handwriting within its video stream. Some restaurants display a menu"
"outside with the day’s fare handwritten on a small blackboard. Search 
applications might want to have the ability to read this from a video feed. 
For our purposes, with recorded documents, our interest is primarily with 
offline transcription."
"The problem of automatic Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) 
persists since document digitization started. Text recognition is a 
simple task for humans, but it has been proved to be complex for 
automatic systems. In fact, it is considered an unsolved problem"
"and under active research…. The high variability between writers 
and the cursive nature of the handwriting text are the main 
difficulties presented by this problem. These difficulties have 
meant that historically, the practical applications of offline"
"handwriting recognition technologies have been quite limited 
(Sueiras 2021) . 
 
To a degree, everyone’s personal handwriting is different. Nevertheless, 
mostly, people are trying to communicate with their handwriting, and they"
"have learned, have been taught, or are required, to write in a way that their 
writing can be read. There are differences in the writers, their writing 
styles, and their purposes. There are differences in the intended roles of the 
product documents."
"299 Some cases are easier to transcribe than others. There is cursive 
handwriting and block handwriting (writing separate letters). For example, 
international arrivals at an airport may be required to hand ‘print’ (i.e. 
block handwrite) their flight and passport details into a form, where some"
"of the fields of the form are required to be text, others known to be dates, 
and yet others known to be numbers. Such handwritten forms can be 
machine read quite easily, even though there may be different authors and 
writing styles involved."
"Documents like those in the Vatican are often official documents of one 
kind or another, written by scribes. In cases like these, not only does the 
scribe personally want the document to be easy to read and definite in 
form, but so does the scribe’s employer (the government, the Queen, the"
"seller of the land, etc.). Scribes need to get it right or lose their jobs  (or 
maybe their heads) . Scribes in a certain cultural setting are usually required 
to follow a specific style (roughly: they have to write in a certain font). Most"
"of the medieval and later documents in the Vatican will have been written 
in the Carolinguan Miniscule font (or later fonts related to it)."
"300

regestorum domini Honorii  pope III”, in the Vatican Registers  
(Donatella Firmani, Merialdo, and Maiorino 2017) . 
 
Many cases  are much more difficult than this. There is a manuscript"
"collection of the works of the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham. 
(Bentham wrote on philosophy and law. He is known mainly for proposing 
Utilitarianism.) Bentham wrote the manuscripts largely himself. But he also 
had helpers who wrote some portions. He wrote mostly in English, but"
"occasionally with pieces in Greek or French or other languages. He made 
corrections, but often leaving the originals and the crossings out in the text. 
He also sometimes wrote in columns, or with included passages."
"301  
 
Figure 26. Sample From a Manuscript by Jeremy Bentham  
(University College London) . 
 
However, coming at this from a different direction, think back a few years  
of your own experiences . A regular High School teacher might receive thirty"
"handwritten essays from students and be able to read them without any 
difficulty. (If there was difficulty, likely the student would be given remedial 
handwriting instruction.) This suggests that ML would allow computers to 
read cursive or block handwriting from a variety of authors. Typical"
"approaches to this in 2023 would likely involve Neural Nets or D eep 
Learning , and this means, basically, that they could be covered by a 
Foundation Model."
"302 11.1.2 Speech to Text  
 
We are all familiar with voice -controlled assistants like Alexa, Siri, or 
Google Assistant. These can take speech, or dictation, and first turn that 
into (computer) text. Usually, the way that this step is done is that an ML"
"program will attempt to recognize and classify the phonemes in the input 
sound. The phonemes are the smallest, or atomic, sound components of 
speech in a language. In English there are about 44 of these. In response to 
dictation, the program will produce a stream of phonemes . Converting this"
"stream into well -formed and sensible text is  hard. But it has been done now 
with 99% accuracy for most well -known common languages. To give some 
idea of the difficulties. In English, there can be the same letters producing"
"different phonemes (‘thin’, ‘these’), different letters producing the same 
phonemes (‘sit’, ‘city’, ‘eight’, ‘ate’). To resolve these, context is required — 
i.e. what makes sense in the wider sample of speech.  Google's Cloud"
"Speech -to-Text V1 supports dictation in hundreds of languages  (Google 
Cloud 2023) . Apple’s software for iPhone covers dictation capabilities for 
about a hundred  languages or their dialects (British, American and 
Australian English, are all listed separately, for example).  Meta's Massively"
"Multilingual Speech (MMS) project is aiming at speech recognition and 
text-to-speech models that can recognize over 4000 languages and work 
with  over 1,100 languages  (Meta 2023) . Meta also open -sources its models 
(which may  be good).  Of course, recognizing a language is one thing, being"
able to take dictation in it at speed is something else.
"303 The training here is largely with audio recordings which have transcripts 
(obviously here resources are meagre with rare or unusual languages). If 
the target language has a text -to-speech converter, that can be used to 
create data."
"Speech -to-text can be used to transcribe speeches and lectures. Text -to-
speech can be used to create audiobooks. The two technologies can be used 
to help people learn languages. The two technologies can be used to help 
people communicate in their preferred language. They can help preserve"
"language diversity and prevent languages from ‘dying’. Languages usually 
die from a lack of use and native speakers. This may come about for a 
variety of reasons (speakers favoring other languages, government policy, 
etc.) . However, the technologies create an infrastructure which retains the"
"knowledge of how a language is to be spoken, written, and read.  
 
There are settings where either typing or writing cannot be used or in which 
they are not the best option. Dictation is usually taken to be much faster 
than typing or writing, maybe 3 -10 times faster. [There is evidence counter"
"to this in certain circumstances such as start to finish form -filling in a 
medical or legal context.] Some situations — for example, if there is 
background noise — are not the best for speech input. But  the choice is 
there. Voice commands, voice input, and the ability to ask questions"
"verbally increase intellectual freedom.  
 
Smartphones are ubiquitous. They can take text input and provide visual 
text output (and some users are astonishing adept at typing their text"
"304 input). They also can work with sound and will usually have a voice -
controlled assistant.  
 
Transcribing spoken language into text makes it easier to search. This may 
be useful for libraries that have audio resources (such as historical"
"recordings of Question -and-Answer  sessions to a parliament , or oral 
histories .) 
 
11.1.3 Sign Language to Text, and Text to Sign Language  
 
There are AI programs to translate sign language to text. These will use 
some means of capturing or ‘viewing’ the images, perhaps a smart phone."
"Then they will classify what is seen. This may be done real time — that is, as 
the same speed as the signs are being given i.e. at conversation speed.  But 
classification of, say, the hand movements is not the only challenge. There"
"are maybe 300 sign languages, and they have different characteristics, of 
course. Usually, a sign language does not consist solely of signs made with 
the hands. Rather there is a wider range of gestures including facial 
expressions and bodily movements. This makes the translation problem"
"much more difficult.  
 
Within libraries, and other repositories of information, text, images, and 
other visual artifacts are the primary display medium. If a person is 
challenged visually, then text -to-speech technologies are very helpful. If a"
"person is challenged aurally, but not visually, then sign -to-text technologies 
are certainly valuable. But the visual text itself would presumably be"
"305 available to such a person, and that would provide a means of access to 
recorded information. There will be cases where sign -to-text technologies 
would help in a library setting — for example, for those who can sign but not"
"read or write. Libraries do have holdings in sound; for example, podcasts , 
recordings of lectures and speeches . Transcription to text might help there.  
 
We are all familiar with important addresses and speeches being signed"
"simultaneously with being spoken. Obviously,  that is a valuable access and 
inclusion technique. But when the focus moves to recordings, say of the 
Australian Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, saying, in 2012, ‘ I will not be"
"lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man...'  , there does not seem to 
be the same need for a signed version. Recordings of the speech are 
available in video, sound, and text.  
 
11.1.4 Helping Filter  and Personalize"
"A problem highlighted by Jorge Luis Borges 's short story The Library of 
Babel  is that just having access to absolutely all information would likely 
prove to be useless because the relevant information would not be able to"
"be found (Wikipedia 2023o) . Intellectual freedom  need s a filtering of 
garbage, and a personalization to provide relevance.  ML can provide that.  
[This  topic will be revisited later.]"
"306 11.1.5 Scholarly Publishing  
 
This is a small aside, but it is an example. Researchers in the western world 
are more -or-less required to publish their research papers in English. Many 
are not native English speakers. There is an awkwardness at this point."
"Some scholarly publishers provide automatic translation to English for all 
submissions  (see, for example, (CHOICE Media Channel 2022) ). 
 
11.1.6 What Can Be Done With Computer Text  
 
Suppose, now, that we have the computer text corresponding to a page, or"
"pages, or books of printed or written characters, or of speech, or of signs. 
What can be done with that? A lot, see Section 1.4.  
 
11.1.7 ELI5 Translation  
 
It is common to see the acronym 'ELI5' on discussion hosts like Reddit."
"ELI5 means 'explain it like I am a 5 year old '. An interesting and fascinating 
point is that LLMs can do this. They can explain passages as though the 
audience were 5-year -olds . But also they can simplify and re -render 
passages at any level whatsoever from 5-year -olds to the level that the"
"passage was written at original (and even go in advance of that perhaps to a 
more sophisticated version)."
"307 This matters for two reasons. It increases intellectual freedom , because it 
makes difficult passages accessible to all,  and it personalizes the delivery of 
information into a form that the user would like  or to a learning style that 
the user needs ."
"11.2 Improving the Intermediation Between 'Users ' and 
'Information Resources '. 
 
11.2.1 Some Users Might Not Be Human  
 
Some Users might be ML programs, or software tools that are employed by 
the human User, or employed by other programs or 'bots'. To a degree, this"
"is true already. For example, many repositories will publish their metadata 
for 'harvesting'. (See, for instance, the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for 
Metadata Harvesting  (Wikipedia 2023k) ). What is happening here is that"
"services are being built off resources that a library or libraries have, or off 
services that libraries offer. Librarians can help this by ensuring that their 
holding are accessible in relevant ways to appropriate 'Users'. Accessibility"
"in this context will likely involve considerations of licensing and intellectual 
property. One type of service that likely will become very important is that 
of text mining. We will look at text mining later."
"308 11.2.2 Some Resources Might Not Be Resources  
 
Some resources might not be resources in the sense of being physical or 
digital texts or documents. They might be services. A library might provide 
a service, for example a certain kind of access to its holdings. A second"
"library might provide a similar or different services. A further party might 
bundle those services into another service.  
 
11.2.3 Digital Archiving  
 
Archiving  is a little different to straightforward librarianship in that it deals"
"almost exclusively with historical materials and its organizational principles 
are often different (for example, in giving pride of place to provenance). 
Digital archiving — preserving digital content for future use — is different yet"
"again. It is one of the many things that commercial and governmental 
institutions do. For example, digital archiving may be mandated for 
compliance reasons — e.g. keep your tax records for 10 years!  
 
11.2.4 Enhanced Search Engines"
"Existing search engines already use machine learning. Companies like 
Google typically do not reveal exactly how their systems work — presumably 
for commercial reasons. But some techniques are known or can be 
surmised.  Google search uses RankBrain, Hummingbird, Panda, Penguin,"
"309 Pigeon, etc., along with the original PageRank algorithm (Wikipedia 2023l; 
2023m; 2023f) . Some, or maybe most, of these use ML. What these 
techniques concern mostly is with ranking the results  that the search 
engines find. Apparently, there are 200 or so ranking factors that can be"
"taken into account. Some of these are to do with the web pages themselves 
(whether they contain real content or are 'click bait'). Some concern the 
users and their search histories. Some even concern the locations of the"
"search origins. For example, in the US the word 'boot' picks out a footwear  
item you wear, in Britain the word 'boot' can mean this but it can also mean 
what Americans would call the 'trunk' of a car. The search engines know 
this and can react accordingly. The search engines also use NLP more"
"generally , and there is considerable amount of m achine learning in NLP.  
 
Commercial search offerings are close to being able to do the following in 
response to a query:  
 
1. Semantic search, augmented by named entity recognition, to"
"produce and return, in the first instance, say, ten links to 
relevant web pages  
2. To summarize those pages at a length and intellectual level 
either suitable for , or requested by , the user  
3. To load the contents of those pages into a LLM ‘database’, thus"
"allowing the user to chat and ask questions about the web page 
contents, with the LLM answering  (with citations)  
4. To construct a knowledge graph from the contents, and from 
this produce topics or references of further interest.  It could 
here produce a list of  related searches."
"310  
The technologies in use here are:  
 
• Semantic search (from NLP, embeddings, and LLMs)  
• Summarization (from NLP and LLMs)  
• Question answering (from NLP , probably vector stores of 
embeddings,  and LLMs)  
• Knowledge graphs (these are infrastructure in this setting — what they"
"are is explained in Appendix E)  
 
One example of a ‘librarian ship paper ’ showing  work of this kind is Kent 
Fitch  Searching for Meaning Rather Than Keywords and Returning 
Answers Rather Than Links  (Fitch 2023) . Fitch writes :"
"Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the largest web 
search engines: for over ten years, public expectations of being 
able to search on meaning rather than just keywords have become 
increasingly realised. Expectations are now moving further: from"
"a search query generating a list of “ten blue links” to producing an 
answer to a question, complete with citations.  
This article describes a proof -of-concept that applies the latest 
search technology to library collections by implementing a"
"semantic search across a collection of 45,000 newspaper articles 
from the National Library of Australia’s Trove repository, and 
using OpenAI’s ChatGPT4 API to generate answers to questions 
on that collection that include source article citations. It also"
"describes some techniques used to scale semantic search to a 
collection of 220 million articles  (Fitch 2023) .  
 
Librarians have expertise in information retrieval . This could be used to 
create search engines that are more effective at understanding and fulfilling"
"user queries.  There already are image searches, with image input or image"
"311 output. There are location -based searches. Google maps tells you of 
restaurants near you, not those on the other side of the continent. There are 
possibilities and opportunities here.  
 
11.2.5 Personalization  and Recommendation"
"What an information provision system is trying to do  in response to a 
perhaps not well articulated request from an individual User is to supply 
that User with all and only the relevant resources (i.e. 100% recall and"
"100% precision) from a well -defined, or not so well -defined, collection of 
items.  [Recall is the percentage of relevant items in the collection that are 
returned. Precision is the percentage of returned items that are relevant.  
Roughly, recall is signal and precision is absence of noise. ]"
"There are explanations and qualifications required here. Martin Frické (2013) 
writes:  
 
Relevance is usefulness to the User as judged by the User. 
Relevance is just a user -controlled honorific that connects [items]  
and utility (on a particular occasion of retrieval). The Patron or"
"User is ultimately the sole arbiter of relevance.  
 
Assume so. This means relevance is subjective in the sense of being User and 
occasion specific. In turn, this means that retrieval is subjective, and the best 
retrieval systems will allow for personalization for individual Users. Separate"
"from this, the boundaries of a collection may be somewhat wooly as they may 
range from a single bookshelf out to a single library from there out to the 
entire Internet."
"312  
ML can personalize provision and retrieval by knowing about a patron and a 
patron's past behavior. Traditionally, libraries have often had advisory 
services. These usually would consist of one or more librarians who would"
"know the local collection and would have experience of patrons, their 
information needs, and the resources from the local collection that would 
meet those needs.  The assessment or feedback on their work might be limited. 
There might be some surveys, or similar, but not much more."
"Computer and AI 'advisory services' would or could know about many users, 
many collections, and would have extensive data and feedba ck as to how it was 
performing  (and improve itself accordingly) . 
 
11.2.6 Recommender Systems"
"We are familiar with recommend er systems from our experiences with 
Amazon , for books or other items, and with Netflix and streaming sites for 
movies . Recommender systems can i mprove  reading experiences.  
 
There are various possibilities here  as to how these might work , which we"
"can describe in a library setting.  Data is need ed, and pretty much the more 
the better. This might include :  
 
• demographics about the User (e.g. whether they are a child or a 
senior citizen)"
"313 • any information that they wish to share about their likes and dislikes 
and preferences (genres, subject matters)  
• their reading or access history  
• information about the books or available resources (perhaps 
includ ing their genres, abstracts, ratings , or reviews)."
"• other relevant factors  
• diversity in plots, characters, authors, genres  
 
There is collaborative filtering which puts the user in the context of other 
similar users and recommends on that basis. There is content -based"
"filtering which pays attention only to the items that the user likes, or seems 
to like, and works with their properties (ignoring information about other 
users). Most systems  will use a hybrid of both approaches. One is that a n"
"anonymous user accesses  or views or reads a single item  and remains 
anonymous (but might have a continuing single session identity). There is 
not much data to work on here. But the item itself will have many 
properties , such as author, subject, genre, length etc. It also might tie into"
"explicit written reviews or feedback from other patrons or even professional 
reviewers or critics. Some sorts of recommendations might be able to be 
made here. The continuing session identity might give some feedback as to 
whether any of the recommendations were followed up on , by the central"
"user,  during that session.  
 
More usual would be the setting where every patron 's accessing history , and 
every item 's accessed history,  is known and recorded as data . (This data can 
be kept private, and identities not revealed.)  This accessing history will be"
'implicit' data about the items accessed. There also will be 'explicit' data
"314 about these items, such as their authors, genres, subject matters, reviews, 
and citations or references or links to them.  At this point,  either just data 
about past interests might be used or data about that supplemented by data"
"about other users and their histories.  Any ongoing behavior by a user can 
be used to update their profile.  
 
Then, probably, either one of two approaches might be made. The first is to 
put the patron into a 'stereotype' (i.e. a class  or group ) consisting of other"
"patrons  similar in respect to the patron seeking recommendations . This 
would be done largely  on the basis of the present reading and the access 
history. The other is not to bother with classes and just to let a ML system"
"look for similarities in reading behavior  across users.  It takes the likes and 
dislikes of the User being helped then overlays those on the likes and 
dislikes of other individual Users to produce a match.  The upshot can be a 
recommendation system that helps users with personalized, perhaps"
"ranked, recommendations as to resources that would be interest, useful, 
and relevant.  
 
Such systems can do more. They might be able to predict how new items , 
yet to be purchased items,  will be received by groups of users — the"
"preferences . And thus, in the case of libraries, they can help with collection 
development."
"315 11.2.7 Understanding What the User is Asking For  
 
Internally, behind the curtain so -to-speak, a traditional information 
retrieval system will likely use Boolean queries or queries in a database 
query language like SQL. But few Users are competent to do input their"
"questions or requirements in this fashion (see, for example, (Frické 2021) ). 
Some Natural Language Processing here could smooth the interface 
between User and such system s. 
 
11.2.8 Text Mining  
 
As described in Chapter 9, text mining can extract a variety of potentially"
"useful information from text such as information regarding named entities, 
topics, classification features, genres, summaries, and sentiments of 
reviews. Any or all of these may help a User narrow an information search 
and thus make it more precise."
"Going a little broader, text mining can look through (usually large) corpora 
for valuable information or patterns. The size of the task makes it hard, if 
not impossible, for humans to do. We have discussed facets of this 
elsewhere — for example, creating an encyclopedia by ML requires text"
"mining . Question answering, summarization, tracking research ideas, etc. 
all require text mining . We will discuss the topic  again in the context of 
Undiscovered Public Knowledge."
"316 One red flag or alert is over the question of licenses or the legal position 
over the mining of texts. In so far as they can, libraries ought to ensure that 
they can mine their holdings. ( Unfortunately, the reality  might be that some"
"other entity will do the mining and charge the libraries for doing so.)  
 
11.2.9 Information Assistants  (and ‘GPTs’)  
 
Let us adopt a form of thinking here. Let us characterize information 
intermediation in terms of tasks  and control  (or flow ). Tasks consist of"
"searching, recommending, paraphrasing, translating, etc. Control (or flow) 
is how the tasks fit together. There is sequential  flow, which is where tasks 
follow each other in a sequence. There is conditional  flow, which is where"
"there is a condition (call it 'if') and if the condition is satisfied (i.e. is true) 
flow goes down one branch (one further sequence of tasks) and if not the 
flow goes down another branch. Finally, there is loop  flow, which is where a"
"sequence of tasks repeats or loops either a given number of times or until a 
condition is satisfied . 
 
Given this structure, informal information algorithms can be constructed. 
For example,  
 
Is there a day of the week that the Musée d'Orsay in Paris is closed 
in July?"
"Is there a day of the week that the Louvre in Paris is closed in 
July?  
If they are both closed on the same day, say what day that is, 
otherwise say which museum is open when the other is closed  and 
what the relevant days are ."
"317  
Look up recent research on  twist ed spin . 
Summarize th e best papers, no more than 5 papers.  
Present the summary at the level understandable by a graduate 
student in physics.  
 
We can conceive of these in terms of flow and tasks, and so can LLMs."
"LLMs can take this kind of input in English, spoken or written, and answer 
it. 
 
[Editorial Note. The first edition of this book continues : 
 
 “The answers, July 2023, may be a bit rough. But it will be only 
months before the answers will be very good."
"In sum. Shortly there will be  information assistants that can 
combine information tools on the spot. Users will be able to mix 
and match tools. That might not matter to library patrons on all 
occasions of their uses of libraries. But the lives of researchers are 
going to be transformed. ”]"
"On November 6th 2023, OpenAI announced ‘GPTs’ and the upcoming GPTs 
Store which will sell  GPTs  or provide them free. As mentioned earlier in 
Section 2.9, there is a builder technology that allows the construction of 
GPTs. GPTs themselves are relatively small assistants or agents based on"
"the underlying LMM GPT -4 Turbo  technology (or its successors). Assistants 
work as partners with humans. Agents are autonomous and once given a 
task or project do not need further human input before completion. Present 
GPTs should probably be classified as assistant s, but agents are only the"
blink of an eye away.
"318 11.3 Improving Traditional Cataloging , Classification , 
and Retrieval Tools  
 
The elephant in the room here is presented  succinctly  by Tamar Sadeh  in 
her doctoral thesis and a series of papers including 'From Search to"
"Discovery' (Sadeh 2015) . The argument is: the traditional approach 
required users to learn library systems and articulate the perfect template 
to launch a search which would then be guaranteed to produce a perfect 
result straight off. In contrast, the modern user could not care less about"
"library systems. In their daily lives, t hey use Google search and do online 
shopping all the time. They enter the information discovery process in a 
sloppy and haphazard way. But get some, or many, results which are then"
"honed to meet their needs.  The process is familiar to them. Sadeh describes 
this:  
 
The designers of traditional library information systems, such as 
library catalogs and databases, were very focused on meeting the 
needs of librarians and expected that users would invest time and"
"effort in learning how to use the system. The designers of 
discovery systems, driven by the needs of end users, strive to 
streamline the end -to-end process of finding and obtaining 
information and make it as simple and friendly as possible. Rather"
"than offering multiple options to enable users to describe their 
information need, discovery systems offer users simple search 
interfaces but complement these with multiple post -search 
options for assessing findings, refining results, and navigating to"
"other results of possible interest. The look and feel of the interface 
is similar to that of other information systems that are familiar to 
users, such as web search engines and online bookstores. 
Furthermore, recognizing that today ’s users spend hardly any"
"time reading instructions, developers have made discovery 
systems very intuitive . (Sadeh 2015, 216)"
"319 So, we can look at the topic  improving retrieval tools, but some  
improvements may be for librarians only.  
 
There is the view from Patrick Wilson and Karen Coyle that traditional 
cataloging theory omits the User from its concerns (Coyle 2016; Wilson"
"1968; Svenonius 1969) . This view invokes descriptive power , describing the 
resource items that libraries have, and exploitive power  which evaluates 
and recommends items suitable for patrons or Users on particular 
occasions. Cataloging does the former, but not the latter to any competent"
"and enthusiastic degree. There is subject classification, but that has not 
been carried out very well  (S. Berman 1971; Frické 2012) . There are other 
library services and tools that help with exploitive power, for example:"
"bibliographies, reference interviews, and similar. But librarianship to date 
has been weak on exploitive power. Relatively new computer supported 
search engines, with ranked returns, and 'recommender' systems are strong"
"in these areas. But ML, especially large language models, have the potential 
to take this to new levels.  
 
Thomas Padilla writes  
 
…semantic metadata can be generated from video materials using 
computer vision; text material description can be enhanced via"
"genre determination or full -text summarization using machine 
learning; audio material description can be enhanced using 
speech -to-text transcription; and previously unseen links can be 
created between research data assets that hold the potential to"
"support unanticipated research questions (Padilla 2019, 12)  
 
This is exactly right. We will supplement this in places  and give detail to some 
of the suggestions."
"320  
Over the millennia  that librarianship has been practiced,  librarians have 
developed many retrieval tools. Here are a few, supplemented with some 
modern techniques:  
  
Abstracts  
Bibliographies  
Book reviews  
Catalogs  
Citation Indexes  
Computer Interfaces"
"Controlled Vocabularies  
Cumulative Indexes  
Databases  
Dictionaries   
Encyclopedias  
Finding Aids  
Handbooks, manuals, etc.  
Indexes  
Inventories  
Keyword s 
Nomenclature  
Ontologies  
Outlines, syllabi, etc  
Pathfinders  
Reference Interviews  
Reference Lists  
Registers"
"321 Reviews  
Search Engines  
Single Entry Term, Phrase, or Keyword, Search Boxes  
Subject Guides  
Summaries  
Tables of Contents  
Textbooks  
Thesauri  
Web Browsers  
 
As we will see, ML will likely be able to improve most of these tools"
"individually  (see, as example s, (Iris.ai 2023; Pickering et al. 2022) ). A 
different consideration is whether ML can replace some of the tools 
entirely . 
 
11.3.1 NLP Inspired Improvements  
 
Most of the AI/NLP areas  of value to librarianship are mentioned and 
described in Chapter 9:"
"• Named Entity Recognition  
• Topic Modeling , Text Classification and Automatic 'Tagging'  
• Controlled Vocabularies, Thesauri, and Ontological Vocabularies  
• Automatic Indexing  
• Text Abstracts, Extracts, Key Phrases, Keywords, and Summaries  
• Sentiment Analysis"
"322 • Author and Genre Recognition and Plagiarism Detection  
• Text Mining and Question Answering  
• Machine Translation  
 
 In general terms, these all make improvements to older techniques . But 
some bring features that are genuinely new :"
"• Topic Modeling  can identify new topics in huge corpuses of texts e.g. 
in social media . 
• Indexing can identify sources outside of the original indexed 
document. This could be useful for research . 
• Sentiment Analysis  can be useful for recommender systems . For"
"individual books, for authors, for genres. For individuals, for the 
patrons as a whole ('trending books') and for collection devel opment . 
• Author and Genre Recognition and Plagiarism Detection .  
• Text Mining and Question Answering . 
• Machine Translation ."
"11.3.2 Metadata Generation  and Automatic Cataloging  
 
Machine learning can certainly be used to create all the forms of metadata 
that are in use in librarianship today i.e. it can do cataloging. (See for 
example (Griffey 2019; Corrado 2021) ). What would be likely here is"
"interactive reinforcement learning or human -in-the-loop learning. That is, 
during the training process  professional catalogers would provide feedback"
"323 as to how well the automatic system is performing.  The catalogers would be 
part of the training.  (Of course, it is not easy to know what good cataloging 
amounts to (Snow 2017) .) 
 
In certain circumstances, automatic  metadata generation has the potential"
"to be very useful. For example, UNESCO has audio recordings that would 
benefit from having metadata. They have about 6500 recordings , in 70 
languages, and some of the recordings are multilingual. What they have 
done in the past is that an i ntern listen s to a recording and picks topics  and"
"personalities.  There are ML systems that can do the speech recognition and 
transcription (for example, Whisper from Open AI (OpenAI 2022b) ). 
Apparently one of the challenges these systems can have is with crosstalk 
(e.g. meetings where several different people talk as and when they feel so"
"inclined).  
 
11.3.3 Some Retrieval Tools  
 
The opportunities or possibilities here are extensive. We will  address  just a 
few examples . 
 
Producing a List of References  that are actually cited  in a text is a trivial 
computer science problem. There are many human -powered citation"
"managers (e.g. EndNote, Zotero, and Microsoft Word), and all of these can 
produce ‘Bibliographies’ (here meaning reference lists, or citation lists). 
True  Bibliographies  are another matter. A ‘True Bibliography’ is being"
"324 understood in this context as being a list of the works used to write or 
produce the text, whether those works  are cited or not . 
 
Producing a true Bibliography  is no easy task. The author or authors of a 
work can do it. But for third party humans or computer programs, it is a"
"challenge . Computational linguistics can classify texts, can identity the 
genre, can identify whether two works were written by the same author, can 
identify plagiarism, etc. But these methods, whether they use ML or not, 
mostly rely on what is in the text explicitly. Locating what is in the"
"background that might have inspired the explicit text is a challenge of a 
different level entirely. As of 202 3, it cannot be done.  
 
Paula Carina de  Araújo  and fellow authors and, separately, Linda Smith, 
provide a good introduction to the vast area of Citation Analysis  and"
"Citation Indexes  (Araújo, Castanha, and Hjørland 2021; L. C. Smith 1981) . 
In brief, a reference is an explicit acknowledgement that one text gives to 
another, and a citation is reference received by a text from another. 
Citations and references can be used to build webs or networks between"
"documents. Such networks , which often amount to citation indexes, can be 
valuable for a variety of scholarly purposes.  Centrally  
 
… (1) they are tools for the scholars seeking knowledge and (2) 
they are tools for the scholars studying science (including"
"scientometricians and information scientists). (Araújo, Castanha, 
and Hjørland 2021)  
 
One point to note about traditional citation analysis is that what is being 
considered is actual citations made by human authors. These citations may"
"325 be made for a variety of reasons. (As Lizzie Gadd notes, the Citation Typing 
Ontology  lists 43 different types of citation (Gadd 2020; Peroni and 
Shotton 2012) .) Let us pick  a semi -random  five of these: is confirmed by ,"
"corrects , critiques , derides , and disagrees with . Consider a particular 
research paper, A, and another research paper B. If the human author of A 
is conscientious and knowledgeable, she may cite B  for any of the five, or"
"other, reasons. But, nevertheless, given the vagaries of life, she may not cite 
B at all. However, the paper A may still be confirmed by B (or correct B or 
critique B etc.).  That is what the paper may do, objectively.  A scholar of"
"ideas, of intellectual history, of the development of the theories in a field, 
may mainly be interested in the relationships between A and B, not in 
whether the author of A cited B. Additionally, consider the time before it"
"was the practice to make citations. Ancient Greek or Roman authors wrote 
texts that, for example, critiqued other texts. Human creators of citation  
indexes or analyses basically can only work with actual citations. But at this"
"point ML and NLP systems have a crucial advantage. They can scan the 
entire research literature and form a knowledge or information map of 
which papers confirm which other papers (or deride which other papers, 
etc.). They can scan the content (as well as the gossip of actual citations)."
"New knowledge mapping tools are, and will be , far superior to their 
traditional counterparts  (see, for example, (Tay 2022)  ). 
 
Moving on. ML system s could write Book Reviews . With fiction, it could 
identify plots, characters, themes, whether the content was 'diverse',"
"intended audience, and other aspects of the document or book. With non -
fiction , it could assess quality by means of coherence,  'groundedness', 
truth -and-evidence,  writing style, citations it uses, citations to it, and other"
"326 indicator s. Also, it could, using sentiment analysis and other NLP 
techniques, collectively assess, summarize, and evaluate reviews written by 
other agents (human or otherwise) . 
 
Libraries make extensive use of Databases . Almost all information about"
"their own individual holdings will be held in databases . Access to these will 
often be via their Catalog , which might be in the form of an Online Public 
Access Catalog . Also, there are any number of commercial and other 
databases that serve as access points to further resources  outside an"
"individual library’s  holdings  (for example, to research papers, to legal 
materials such as citations and precedents) . An academic library might 
provide access to hundreds of outside databases . Of course, databases will 
be used in the everyday administration and management of libraries (such"
"as for patron and circulation records, for staff salaries, etc.).  
 
Database  theory  is a specialist area, widely studied in computer science. 
Databases themselves provide organization to their contents . They also 
should be able to do so in a structured and provably correct way.  They"
"support CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete). There is, or 
can be, plenty of automation in connections with databases, for example, 
with checking the data on entry (for format, reliability, etc .), checking"
"integrity, following a backup or archiving or compliance policy . It is not 
clear quite what role machine learning might have in this domain. ML can 
program a database. It can do any computer programming approaching the 
level of professional programmers. How good it would be a design is an"
"open question. This is an area where there are many formal techniques — 
Entity -Relationship diagrams and the like — and ML would presumably"
"327 easily master those. Machine learning can have plenty of relevance to the 
contents of databases, picking up patterns in the data for one reason or 
another (for example, identifying fraudulent transaction s in a financial"
"database). Somewhat similarly  in a library setting  machine learning will be 
able to identify usage patterns in the resource s— for example, which 
resources are used by which segments of the patrons — and thus aid 
acquisitions and collection management."
"Traditional  Catalogs  list all the materials held in a library. The lists will 
have data and metadata about the resources. If a library physically issues 
books and materials, a catalog might assist with lending, checking"
"availability, placing holds, etc. All of these functions benefit, or will have 
benefitted, from computer automation. The old timey favorite  Card 
Catalog was a technology  to help the patrons find items among those 
materials  listed in the Catalog . As computers, networks, and automation"
"came in the Card Catalogs evolved into Online Public Access Catalogs  
(OPACs).  OPACs steadily acquired additional functions such as access to 
materials in other libraries or in other formats like databases. OPACs are 
probably drifting off into the sunset (Wells 2021) . There is a better"
"alternative , the so -called  Discovery Systems  (such as Primo VE, Summon, 
or EBSCO Discovery Service) . Tamar Sadeh writes : 
 
Discovery systems provide access to a large, diverse information 
landscape of scholarly materials regardless of where the materials"
"are located, what format they are in, and whether the library owns 
them or subscribes to them. At the same time, these systems 
typically offer simple, Google -like searching as the default option, 
to accommodate the expectations of today’s users. With this type"
"of searching, users do not spend much time formulating queries, 
and their queries often yield large result sets; theref ore, discovery"
"328 systems focus on relevance ranking and on tools that help users 
easily navigate and refine result sets. Librarians have welcomed 
the advances in discovery services for their users. However, this 
new reality poses challenges to the practices that librarians have"
"developed over the years and, in some cases, is at odds with the 
systematic, controlled approach to searching endorsed by 
librarians  (Sadeh 2015) .  
 
(with, for example, personalization and recommendation — such as Primo 
VE, Summon, or EBSCO Discovery Service)."
"LLMs can create Dictionaries  — after all, they will have seen mass ive 
amounts of text in its natural contexts.  Many dictionaries provide examples 
in use. LLMs would be able to provide richer and more comprehensive 
examples. Right now , though, 2023, it would be usual to construct"
"dictionaries by editing  existing dictionaries. Merriam -Webster’s dictionary, 
for example, is about 200 years old, and about 1000 new words are added 
each year.  Words are removed also.  There are corpora — collections of real"
"world text — for example, the Open American National Corpus (anc 2023) . 
Computer analysis of corpora tells which words are new and how frequently 
they appear , and also which words are drifting out of use . Then , presently,"
"human judgement, assisted by computers, make s decisions on how to edit  
the dictionary.  The whole process could surely be done by ML and LLMs on 
their own. The LL Ms in question would presumably have some downstream 
training from human experts.   The commercial companies — such as"
"Merriam -Webster — do use artificial intelligence , as examples to 
personalize the experience to the User  and to provide usage examples and 
notes ."
"329 There are Encyclopedia s that have  in part, or in whole,  been created by ML  
 
• Wikipedia  uses AI … ‘This  [use]  may be directly involved with 
creation of text content, or in support roles related to evaluating 
article quality, adding metadata, or generating images ’ (Wikipedia"
"2023p)  
• Wikimedia is using ML to help with images for Wikidata  (Redi 2018)  
• Encylopedia.com  (Encyclopedia.com 2019 ). This is  an access point, 
rather than an encyclopedia in itself. It gives access to 200 other 
encyclopedias and can search and summarize."
"• Numina Group’s Warehousing ‘Encyclopedia’  (NuminaGroup 2023)  
(This is more of a glossary or catalog.)  
 
ML created encyclopedias  could or should be completely up to date, 
accurate, and comprehensive. They might be expensive, biased, and with 
some entries that were hallucinations."
"A Pathfinder  is: 
 
A subject  bibliography  designed to lead the user through the 
process of  researching a specific  topic, or any topic in a 
given  field  or discipline, usually in a systematic, step -by-step way, 
making use of the best  finding tools the  library  has to offer  (Reitz"
"2014) . 
 
The finding tools mentioned here include: catalogs, bibliographies, indexes, 
abstracts, bibliographical databases, and search (by author, title, topic, and 
keywords)."
"330 Machine learning can improve pathfinders in many ways:  
 
• The whole task of producing a pathfinder can be done automatically . 
• It can personalize a pathfinder to a User, instead of their being a 
single pathfinder for many Users.  
• Its search will be better."
"• It can find and follow topics even wh en those topics do not have their 
own metadata by having been catalogued by the library systems . 
• Indexes will be better.  
• Abstracts will be better.  
 
11.4 Chatbots  
 
Chatbots have been in use in libraries for at least ten years (McNeal and"
"Newyear 2013; Weigert 2020) . They are improving. They have the potential 
to do, or interface to, most of the current tasks where librarians interact 
with patrons. Most obviously here are Reference Interviews. There may be 
a loss of some personal touch. But the gain might be a tireless expert"
"reference librarian for every patron, available 24 hours a day 7 days a week. 
Another possibility is that of supplementing Frequently Asked Questions 
(FAQs). After all, at the start of a freshman year at a college, there may be"
"several thousand students wanting to ask the same routine questions (such 
as the opening hours for the campus libraries). Chatbots might also 
produce a thinning or abandonment of present -day library websites. A 
deeply structured website will often not be the best way of directing users to"
the resources on offer  (Wikipedia 2022e; Thoppilan et al. 2022) .
"331 There may be a loss of personal touch. There may be a gain of personal 
touch — some folk are really enchanted with chatting with chatbots.  There is 
some evidence that chatbots outside a library setting do not provide a good"
"'customer experience'  (ujet.cx 2022b; 2022a) (Standard point: one benefit 
might be indefinitely many tireless expert reference librarians, enough for 
one for every patron, available 24 hours a day 7 days a week.)  
 
Librarians would be valuable, perhaps even necessary, in the creation of"
"suitable chatbots. Likely the chatbots will use the GUS architecture with 
frames with slots (Bobrow et al. 1977) . (The frames provide the contexts, 
and the slots the values of the variable for the data such as the questions 
and answers.) Librarians have a better idea than most what the frames"
"should be for a librarianship setting . 
 
11.4.1 Reference Interviews  
 
Some librarians either are reference librarians, or, as part of their duties, 
conduct reference interviews. Librarians here are acting as intermediaries"
"between patrons or Users and reference or information sources. A few years 
ago, the aim of a reference interview was to match a patron’s needs to a 
single library’s resources. Nowadays the resources would be assumed to 
extend outside a single library perhaps to all libraries and, indeed, to the"
"Internet itself.  
 
Several sources provide the same instructional guide to librarians as to how 
to conduct a successful reference interview. Here is a typical outline :"
"332  
Purpose : 
Allows staff to match the customer’s question to a relevant 
and useful source of information.  The aim of the interview is 
to answer the patron’s questions using the library’s 
resources.  
 
Guide To A Successful Reference Interview : 
1. Approachability  
2. Interest"
"3. Listening/Inquiring  
4. Searching  
5. Follow -up 
 
1. Approachability  
Pay attention to both your own and the customer’s body 
language.  Acknowledge and greet the customer as they 
approach the desk.  Ensure the customer has your full 
attention.  
2. Interest  
Maintain eye contact"
"Find a confidential location for the customer to ask a 
question  
Restate and rephrase the question  
Speak in a relaxed tone  
Make the customer feel comfortable  
Nod your head when the customer starts to ask questions  
3. Listening/Inquiring  
Do not interrupt  
Ask clarifying questions"
"Let the customer express their needs in their own words  
Ask open -ended questions to probe about their information 
needs  
Examples:  
Tell me more about the sources of information you 
already consulted?  
Why do you need the information?  
How will you use the information?  
Remember, WORF"
"Welcoming, Listen Carefully  
Open-Ended Questions"
"333 Repeat their answer back to the customer  
Follow -up to ensure they’ve found the information  
4. Searching  
Keep the customer informed of the progress  
Offer referrals  
Offer to instruct the customer on how  
Ask clarifying questions:  
Do you want printed information that you can take"
"home with you?  
Do you have access to a comp uter so you can look up 
sources online?  
5. Follow -up 
Asking the customer if they have everything they need 
ensures that the customer is satisfied with the transaction . 
If the follow -up questions indicate that the customer is not 
satisfied:"
"Clarify what information is missing  
Offer to continue working on answering the question  
Refer the customer to another organization if material 
is not available at your library  
 
[The author  dislikes  the use of the word 'customer' but maybe that is just 
him.]"
"him.] 
 
ML and LLMs can certainly excel at all this. Joseph Vincze has a useful 
discussion in his paper 'Virtual Reference Librarians (Chatbots) ' (Vincze 
2017) . [A caution: that paper was written before the advent of ChatGPT.]  
 
11.4.2 Virtual Services"
"There have been Virtual Reference Desks, Ask -a-Librarian web pages, and 
Chat -with -a-librarian through a web page, more -or-less since the internet 
expanded and became popular. Some of these have been retired, for"
"334 example the Library of Congress Virtual Reference Desk was retired around 
2020.  
 
The LLMs complete change the game on this. You can have ChatGPT on 
your smartphone. That is a virtual reference desk, without needing a library"
"or librarians.  As of June 2023, ChatGPT is not perfect with accuracy, 
providing references, and avoiding hallucinations. But it is improving all 
the time, and there are good reasons to suppose that ChatGPT with 
appropriate plugins will outperform any extant virtual reference desks."
"Librarians might work with ML researchers to create the plugins.  
 
11.4.3 Chatbots as Continuous User Testing of a Library's Public 
Interface.  
 
This might be controversial, and it certainly would need handling carefully."
"But chatbot transcripts would throw good light on what patrons actually do, 
or plan to do, while using a library's resources. For example, a web page 
with a large number of show/hide toggles (accordion widgets) may prove 
hard to follow; a chatbot leading a user through the page could provide"
"feedback on this.  
 
11.5 Release, Produce, or Curate Training Data  
 
ML is only as good as its data. Training data is hard to come by. It needs to 
be plentiful, and it needs to be of high quality. For supervised learning, the"
"335 data needs to be labeled accurately. Librarians are well placed here with all 
kinds of suitable data. They already have rich metadata on traditional 
resources, including shelf classification, subject classification, and indexes."
"And they can produce new kinds of data. For example, the READ -COOP 
projects to use handwriting recognition on archives of historical documents 
(READ -COOP 2021) . These projects can involve  creating and inspiring 
crowdsourcing to  produce data at scale, e.g."
"Transcribe Bentham  is an  award -winning  participatory initiative 
which launched in 2010.  Its aim is to engage the public in the 
online transcription of original and unstudied manuscripts 
written by Jeremy Bentham, his correspondents, and his 
amanuenses.  (UCL 2018)"
"(For an explanation of crowdsourcing see (Wikipedia 2023c) .)  
 
Public librarians can inspire crowdsourcing. Many modern ML projects, 
especially Large Language Models, and Foundation Models, use 
crowdsourcing in their training. For this they generally need 'ordinary'"
"people, but collectively the crowds would usually need to be diverse (as to 
race, ethnicity, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, etc.). Public libraries 
interface with many hundreds of thousands of exactly the kinds of folk that 
would be suitable, possibly even ideal."
"336 11.6 Debunking , Disinformation, Misinformation, and 
Fakes   
 
Librarians have always  been active with information literacy , which is 
helping users and patrons to become more discerning and skillful in their 
approaches to information resources. (We will discuss this again later.) But,"
"in addition to this more general raising of skills on the part of users there is 
or can be a scrutiny of the actual resources themselves.  There are problems 
aplenty nowadays with disinformation, misinformation, fake news, deep 
fakes and the like  (Meszaros and Goodsett 2022) . Traditionally,"
"librarianship would not pass a view on the veracity of sources or on 
evidence. Librarians would remain neutral, for example, between resources 
on evolutionism and on creationism (and there are good free speech 
arguments for doing this). But there is considerable value now in fact 
checking."
"Librarians already help patrons to fact check e.g. (Knapp 2021) . Many 
libraries and library associations are deeply involved in fact checking  Really 
this is a part of epistemology, perhaps social epistemology.  
 
11.7 Social Epistemology"
"Margaret Egan and Jesse Shera introduced social epistemology as being : 
 
… the analysis of the production, distribution, and utilization of 
intellectual products in much the same fashion as that in which 
the production, distribution, and utilization of material products"
have long been investigated .(Egan and Shera 1952)
"337  
 
One core part of this concerns what we know — the true beliefs we have —as 
individuals  and collectively. Most of what we know individually comes from 
other people via recorded knowledge. Certain practices regarding that"
"recorded information can promote, or inhibit,  social knowledge (i.e. 
knowledge aggregated across individuals).  As an obvious example,  easy 
wide access to recorded information promotes social knowledge whereas 
censorship inhibits it. Some qualifications are needed to this example. Too"
"much information might overwhelm our attention and interest. A little 
censorship , or filtering, or curating,  might highlight the pearls among the 
dark sea of many biased and unsupported opinions.  Egan and Shera, and 
other later researchers, such as Don Fallis, Steve Fuller, and Alvin"
"Goldman, have seen the promotion of social knowledge as being a vital 
function of librarianship (Fallis 2006; 2002; Fuller 1988; Goldman 1999; 
Egan and Shera 1952) . 
 
Librarians are experts at traditional information acquisition, and"
"information provision practices.  That is a good start.  But machine learning 
is both going to provide more powerful tools to help with social knowledge 
and, perhaps a mixed blessing here, a vast amount more source material for"
"those tools to be used on. Here is a conjecture about recorded text, 
especially new materials on the Internet and on Social Media. The Large 
Language Models, such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing, can write English, and 
other  languages, as well as native speakers. They can do so quickly, much"
"quicker than native writers, and cheaply, much cheaper than native writers. 
Very shortly, tools from these models will be in the hands of anyone that"
"338 wants them (as tools on the web or in word processors or stand -alone apps 
on smartphones, tablets, or computers). What the tools will produce will be 
plausible in terms of vocabulary and grammar. Some of the textual 
products will be information. Others will be misinformation. Some will be"
"'hallucinations'. Some will be fiction, intending to be fiction. Some will be 
fiction, not intending to be fiction.  It seems that ML source creators will be 
as ubiquitous as spell checkers are today — every means of producing 
content will have available an LLM assistant."
"What might be  roles for librarians  in connection with ML and social 
epistemology ? Here are some possibilities:  
 
• Fact checking. Help with identifying misinformation, disinformation  
and 'false facts' . 
• Help with cognitive biases . Many folk  have trouble with reasoning —"
"with hypotheses, evidence and truth. Indeed, one experiment showed 
that 50% of Harvard Physicians can commit the base -rate fallacy.  
(The base -rate fallacy is explained in  Appendix C.2.) A I can help keep 
people on track.  AI can construct proof trees from arguments and"
"evidence.  There are other relevant cognitive biases. For example, the 
phenomenon of confirmation bias suggest s that almost everyone 
mistakenly favors evidence that supports their views, downplaying or 
ignoring disconfirming evidence. ML and LLMs do not cause this, but"
"they can be used to counter -act it. For example, for patrons interested 
in balanced view of, say, climate change, librarians, using LLMs could 
find the confirming and disconfirming evidence. The librarian’s role 
here would be part synergist, part sentry, and part educator."
"339 • There is the notion of Veritism, or truth -centered epistemology 
(Kitcher 2002; Nawar 2021) , and from this the question ari ses of 
whether social  epistemology needs to be veritistic. There is the need 
for input from philosophy.  Once there is an acceptable answer to this,"
"ML may be able to help . 
• There is the view, now becoming widespread, that Peer Review  as 
used, for example, in scholarly publishing has failed. One proponent  
of this is Adam Mastroianni  (Econtalk 2023) . ML can do everything 
that peer review is supposed to do: check spelling, grammar,"
"citations, diagrams and figures, calculations, originality, contribution 
to the research field, absence of plagiarism, etc.  
 
11.8 Robots  
 
For convenience here, we will divide robots into three categories: chatbots, 
humanoid robots, and non -humanoid robots. [There may be some overlap"
"of these boundaries; for example, a humanoid robot might have chatbot 
capabilities. ] Then, orthogonal to this, a physical library  may be using 
robots, or providing access to  robots.  
 
Chatbots are discussed elsewhere  (and there are many opportunities  for"
"librarians  with chatbots) . Humanoid robots are beginning to be introduced 
as companions and helpers to the elderly in rest homes. There are also 
some uses in nursing.  Such robots are often mobile and can converse. The 
'humanoid' part usually includes humanlike expressions of emotions and"
gestures. These can engender trust and reduce anxiety on the part of the
"340 people the robots are interacting with. Somewhat similarly to being helpers 
in rest home, robots have been trialed in public libraries . As examples  of 
actual uses , being a teller of stories in story -telling sessions for children,"
"being a greeter to the library and answering directional or locational 
questions to books or resources  (Nguyen 2020; Kim 2017) . Non -humanoid 
robots, for example, welding robots used in the manufacture of cars, would 
usually appear as part of the automation of processes. There has been"
"inventory control in general, using RFID  (Radio Frequency Identification)  
labels and chips, since the 1980s. This means that it is relatively easy to 
automate closed stack systems (where the public do not browse the books 
on the shelves). The physical collection can be 'in the basement' and"
"automation will do the rest. RFID, and similar technologies, are also 
invaluable with open stack systems. A hand -held scanner, or a wand, or 
even built in systems, in the shelves or walls of the building, will find, for 
example, any book or identify that it is missing. Increasing use of"
"automation may be useful, but there does not seem to be a large role for 
robots. As to libraries providing access to robots, robots are going to be an 
important part of our future. This suggests that librarians can help educate"
"the populace by, for example, lending robots or having makerspaces with 
access to robots or having educational seminars on robots.  
 
In sum. It is unclear quite what might happen  in general with humanoid 
and non -humanoid robots in libraries, and what the opportunities might"
be. (See also (Tella 2020; Tella and Ajani 2022) .)
"341 11.9 Images  
 
A considerable portion of ML concerns imaging or has images as its subject 
matter. There are various librarianship related problems here e.g. 
recognizing or classifying images, attaching metadata to images, searching"
"among a collection of images, perhaps where the input is itself an image, 
and so forth. Images are reasonably important within librarianship. There 
are libraries with images as part of their collections. But also, many text 
sources, for example newspapers, have images or diagrams within their"
"content. Additionally, there is film or video.  
 
Such sources can be digitized, and from there processed using ML for 
certain tasks. It all becomes a matter of numbers and patterns in numbers. 
Some modern foundation models are, or aspire to be, 'multi -modal'. This"
"means that they can work with source and output in any medium (e.g. text, 
or images, etc.)  
 
An example is Benjamin Lee et al. The Newspaper Navigator Dataset: 
Extracting And Analyzing Visual Content from 16 Million Historic"
"Newspaper Pages in Chronicling America  (Lee et al. 2020) . They write in 
their abstract : 
 
… we introduce a visual content recognition model trained on 
bounding box annotations of photographs, illustrations, maps, 
comics, and editorial cartoons collected as part of the Library of"
"Congress’s Beyond Words crowdsourcing initiative and 
augmented with additional annotations including those of 
headlines and advertisements. We describe our pipeline that 
utilizes this deep learning model to extract 7 classes of visual"
"342 content: headlines, photographs, illustrations, maps, comics, 
editorial cartoons, and advertisements, complete with textual 
content such as captions derived from the METS/ALTO OCR, as 
well as image embeddings for fast image similarity querying."
"We have here machine learning, crowdsourcing, additional annotations… 
on 16 million pages. Respect!

Apparently there have been robots in libraries for some time. Here , from 1965, is  
Lawrence Lipton demonstrating  his 'robot ' Duhab ( Detector of Undesirable"
"Habitu és). Duhab finds undesirables such as censors and book burners.

12.1 Copyright and Intellectual Property  
 
As librarians license access to content from vendors, we need to 
ensure that contracts do not preclude our users from conducting 
text and data -mining research, algorithmically based research,"
"and machine learning . (Miller 2020)  
 
12.2 Intellectual Freedom  
 
Chat GPT tells us that i ntellectual freedom has several drawbacks, 
including:  
 
• Misinformation and false ideas: People may spread false or harmful 
ideas that are protected under the umbrella of intellectual freedom."
"• Conflict with other values: Intellectual freedom may conflict with 
other values such as privacy, security, and safety, leading to difficult 
ethical dilemmas.  
• Limits to freedom: In some cases, laws and regulations may limit"
"intellectual freedom in order to protect public interest or prevent 
harm.  
• Divide between different perspectives: Intellectual freedom may lead 
to a fragmentation of perspectives and ideas, making it more difficult 
for society to reach consensus on important issues."
"344 • Resistance to change: Some individuals and groups may resist new 
ideas and perspectives, leading to resistance to social and cultural 
change.  
 
[OpenAI . ( 2023) This paragraph was written with ChatGPT .] 
 
12.3 Censorship  and Algorithmic Curation"
"Librarians can defend against censorship. ML is not directly a censor, but 
many of the techniques it enables and improves — such as personalization, 
recommendation, search — can lead to inadvertent censorship. The 
techniques  can lead to filters and to placing individual  patrons within their"
"own bubbles, or silos, of information to the exclusion of the wider world of 
information.  Customization is good  and will presumably be appropriate 
and well received by patrons. But censorship is bad. There needs to be a 
balance. Removing inappropriate and offensive content entirely can be"
"good, but it is hard to draw the boundary lines. Social media are also 
present. One would not ordinar ily think extensively about social media in 
the context of libraries, but social media is a gatekeeper to some, perhaps 
even most, of the information that students and patrons obtain. There is"
"also the 'manipulative capabilities of algorithmic processes' — the abilities 
of algorithmic processes to influence a person's thought, emotions, and 
decisions (IFLA 2020, 5) . In some ways this is not a lot different to 
advertising or propaganda . But ML is more powerful and less obvious and"
"transparent. Librarians might have a role as sentries here. They have a 
history of protecting patrons, and to arm wrestling with censorship."
"345 Some AI tools improve access to information, but there is a need to check 
that the improvements are available to all including to people with 
disabilities.  
 
There is also inadvertent censorship. ChatGPT tells us:"
"Inadvertent censorship refers to the unintended restriction of information 
or expression due to various factors. Here are some examples:  
 
• Technical difficulties: Technical glitches or failures in communication 
systems can unintentionally restrict access to information or 
expression."
"• Overzealous filtering: Some internet filtering systems, designed to 
protect users from harmful content, can inadvertently censor 
legitimate information or expression.  
• Misapplication of laws: Laws and regulations designed to protect"
"national security, public order, or public morals can be misapplied, 
leading to the unintentional restriction of information or expression.  
• Economic considerations: Economic factors, such as the cost of 
publishing or distributing materials, can lead to the unintentional"
"restriction of information or expression.  
• Social norms: Social norms and cultural biases can lead to the 
unintentional restriction of information or expression that goes 
against the prevailing norms and biases.  
 
[OpenAI . (2023) This paragraph was written with ChatGPT .]"
"346  
12.4 Privacy  
 
Centrally, this concerns Users' behavior and patron data. Privacy is a core 
value of librarianship (American Library Association 2006; E. Berman 
2018) . The main justification for this is to allow patrons intellectual 
freedom."
"Lack of privacy and confidentiality has a chilling effect on users' 
selection, access to, and use of library resources  (American 
Library Association 2006) .  
  
Modern computerized libraries typically use Integrated Library Systems"
"(ILS) (sometimes known as Library Management Systems (LMS)) to 
manage  their services . These systems  collect data , some of it about 
individual patrons (e.g. name, age, address, email, phone, driver 's license, 
gender, borrowing history, etc.) (E. Berman 2018) . Outside agencies, for"
"example credit reporting , and credit card,  companies also collect  data about 
individuals.  It is possible to collate data across different systems, for 
example to use library patron data in conjunction with credit card data."
"Collation like this — data collected for one purpose being used  without 
consent  for another — should never happen. But it would be wishful 
thinking to suppose that it never does. There are issues here of privacy and 
consent."
"Librarians might be watchful that ML applications meet the required legal 
and ethical standard."
"347  
12.5 Bias  
 
ML systems can be biased, and often will be if they are LLMs pre -trained by 
self-supervision on large quantities of internet sourced digitized text. Some 
of these biases can be corrected relatively easily by prompting, fine -tuning,"
"or plugins. But it is helpful to all if it is known what the biases are. 
Librarians can be on guard to ensure that their services are fair, equitable, 
and do not commit harms of representation or omission. As mentioned 
earlier, librarians do manag e bias in many aspects of their work, for"
"example with collection development. Most of these traditional forms of 
potential biases are nothing to do with machine learning, nor have been 
caused by machine learning. However, ML may be able to help with 
redressing them.  
 
12.6 Social Epistemology"
"12.6.1 Reliability, Validity, and Over Confidence  
 
Most machine learning systems can make mistakes. Generally, they work in 
terms of probabilities and will not give the same answer twice. This means 
that there is a problem with reliability. Further, if the different answers"
"contradict or are inconsistent with each other, some answers must be plain 
wrong. This means that there is a problem with validity. In research  in 
general , if the researcher has an instrument that is unreliable and lacking in"
"348 validity, typically that instrument would just be discarded. The probabilities 
here also concealed. An LLM would not ordinar ily say 'there is a 70% 
chance of rain and a 30% chance of sunshine'. Rather, it would say"
"definitively 'it will rain!' about 70% of the time, and, definitively, 'there will 
be sunshine!' about 30% of the time. The LLM displays an exaggerated 
confidence that a user might have difficulty in assessing  and understanding ."
"Librarians can help patrons with attitudes to information that ML systems 
provide . 
 
12.6.2 Confirmation Bias  and Poor Reasoning  
 
As mentioned in Section 11.7, librarians, assisted by AI, can pay attention to 
cognitive biases.  
 
12.6.3 Misinformation"
"Librarians can guard against misinformation. They can ensure that the 
information provided to patrons is accurate, reliable, and up to date .  
 
12.6.4 Awareness of the Digital Literacy of Patrons  
Librarians  can have a sense of the information and digital literacy among"
"the community of patrons in their libraries. If there are shortcomings, the"
"349 librarians can provide further guidance, education , and support, especially 
with the question of how ML impacts the information patrons  receive.  
 
Going forward, ML is going to provide many systems and tools for 
librarianship. Librarians themselves can evaluate these tools to ensure they"
"meet the needs of their patrons  and the communities . 
 
12.7 Chatbots  
 
An eye needs to be kept on c hatbots . There is the well-known historical 
example of Microsoft's Tay  from 2016 (Wikipedia 2023n) . Once in the wild"
"and available to all, this chatbot  degenerated into sexist and racist garbage 
within a day. This is an old example now. Also, it was configured to learn 
from the people it was talking to, and ba d actors set out to lead it astray. 
They succeeded."
"Chatbots  can have several drawbacks, including:  
 
• Limited understanding: Chatbots are limited in their understanding 
of human language and context, leading to misunderstandings and 
inaccurate responses.  
• Lack of emotions: Chatbots lack emotions and empathy, making it"
"difficult for them to fully understand human behavior and respond in 
a meaningful way."
"350 • No creativity: Chatbots lack creativity and imagination, which can 
limit their ability to provide innovative solutions to complex 
problems.  
• Inflexibility: Chatbots are designed to follow specific scripts and 
rules, making it difficult for them to adapt to changing circumstances"
"or new information.  
• Reliance on data: Chatbots rely on data and algorithms to generate 
responses, which can perpetuate biases and perpetuate harmful 
information.  
• Security risks: Chatbots can be vulnerable to hacking and other forms"
"of cyber -attacks, which can compromise sensitive information and 
put users at risk.  
• Technical limitations: Chatbots can be limited by technical 
constraints, such as limited processing power, storage capacity, and 
connectivity.  
 
[OpenAI . (2023) This paragraph was written with ChatGPT.]"
"12.8 Personalization  and  Paternalism  
 
Search usually will rank the links it returns. If there is ranking,  or 
personalization,  there is further opportunity for error or malfeasance. Most 
obviously the finger is on the scales with systems that allow sites to pay the"
"search providers for higher positions in the ranked returns. ML systems 
need to be scrutinized in these areas."
"351 Paternalism ‘is to act for the good of another person without that person’s 
consent, as parents do for children’ (Suber 1999) . Generally speaking, 
outside of concerns of machine learning:  
 
• parents being paternalistic to their own children is fine,"
"• some adults, such as teachers, being paternalistic to other peoples’ 
children can be fine,  
• some adults, such as doctors and nurses, being paternalistic to adults 
can be fine,  
• otherwise , adults being paternalistic to other full  competent adults is 
often suspect."
"There is an extensive literature  on paternalism in librarianship, especially 
in so far as that might apply  to children. (See, for example, (Frické, 
Mathiesen, and Fallis 2000) .) This is a complex area. But there is a 
statement from John N. Berry that gets to the nub of the issue:"
"Nor must we deprive [children] of the nurture, the helping hand, 
the guidance, the tools for seeking truth and knowing when it is 
discovered. We cannot simply turn them loose in our jaded 
information society without helping them understand that some"
"of the information is false, is evil, is dangerous, is misleading, or is 
ambiguous... That may not be a legal obligation, but it is clearly a 
moral duty for every librarian, every teacher, every parent and 
person in a free society  (Berry 1998) ."
"(Berry wrote this in 1998, long before LLMs and a powerful internet. )"
"352 The present text is primarily on research libraries and advancing 
knowledge. Children are not front and center here. Nevertheless, LLMs 
have the potential to act for good and to cause harm , both to children and 
to adults . Attention should be paid to questions of when paternalism is"
"appropriate  and when it should be avoided.  Helping folk understand that 
some ‘information’ from LLMs is false, evil, dangerous, misleading, or 
ambiguous is a good idea , even if it might amount to paternalism.  
 
 
12.9 Images  and Facial Recognition Technology"
"Attaching metadata to images is going to have its adventures. It is going to 
make mistakes. There are going to be false positives and false negatives. 
What turns on this is an open question. A notorious example is from 2015"
"when Google Photos misclassified Jacky Alciné  and his friend, who are both 
black, as being gorillas. It is not really known why this happened, nor, it 
seems, has it been fixed (Grant and Hill 2023) . The author has had a mildly"
"similar experience himself. In 2016, Richard Lee, a New Zealand man of 
Asian descent, had his passport photograph rejected by software because 
'his eyes were closed'. Lee, an engineering student, told Reuters ' No hard 
feelings on my part, I’ve always had very small eyes and facial recognition"
"technology is relatively new and unsophisticated ' (Reuters 2016) . (Give him 
a medal for saying that.) The present author is a New Zealander, and 
around 2016 he tried to renew his New Zealand passport and the passport 
robot rejected his photographs because 'his eyes were closed'. A couple of"
matchsticks and Photoshop fixed that!
"353 Attention does need to be paid to the attachment of metadata to images.  
 
Facial recognition technology in a general setting is discussed earlier in 
Section 7.7.3 (Buolamwini et al. 2020; American Library Association 2018) ."
"Our guess is that it will be used in libraries, without controversy, wherever 
and whenever patrons need to establish their identities e.g. when 
borrowing books.  Tracking patrons is another matter. Attention needs to be 
paid  to it.  
 
12.10 Losing Jobs"
"There  is a standard answer to questions of automation causing loss of jobs. 
It is:  automation automates routine repetitive jobs thus freeing up workers 
to do more complex and valuable tasks.  Of course, this does not mean that"
"there will be no loss of jobs. There is a standard text on this question. It is 
Kenning Arlitsch and Bruce Newell's Thriving in the Age of Accelerations: 
A Brief Look at the Societal Effects of Artificial Intelligence and the"
"Opportunities for Libraries  (Arlitsch and Newell 2017) . It is slightly old in 
that since  2017  LLMs have opened the floodgates on what AI can do.  Daron 
Acemoglu has a briefing Get Ready for the Great AI Disappointment  which"
"argues that the effects of LLMs in the near term will prove to be ‘so -so 
automation’ which perhaps displaces workers but with out large gains in 
productivity (Acemoglu 2024) ."

"355 Chapter 13: Librarians as Educators  
 
13.1 Information Literacy  (for Consumers of 
Information ) 
 
Information literacy in the age of AI is a new beast. As always, there is the 
helping patrons and users navigate the interface between information and"
"their good selves. But there is a lot more now adays , now we have machine 
learning, large language models, and  algorithmic pipeline s that might use 
biased data  and might produce biased results.  
 
13.2 Artificial Intelligence Literacy"
"What does ‘AI literacy' entail? Alongside basic digital literacy and 
[Information Technology] skills, ‘AI literacy’ usually begins with 
an elementary understanding of how Artificial 
Intelligence and Machine Learning work , what they can 
and cannot do (IFLA 2020, 10 their emphasis) ."
"Michael  Ridl ey and Danica Pawlick -Potts write : 
 
Navigating the effects of AI as well as utilizing it in a responsible 
way requires a level of awareness, understanding, and skill that is 
not provided by current digital literacy or information literacy"
"regimes  (Ridley and Pawlick -Potts 2021a) .  
 
Others express similar views. For example, Charlie Harper writes : 
 
The privacy (or really lack thereof) and ethics of data collection 
and dissemination should become an integral part of information"
"literacy services. Now that images, video, and audio can be faked"
"356 in staggering ways, the reality of source origin is becoming 
increasingly messy, too. Facilitating and promoting critical 
thinking and awareness within the community is a must (Harper 
2018) . 
 
Librarians have the opportunity to  help the population with this new kind"
"of information literacy. There are some new labels that are appearing here, 
for example, 'AI literacy', 'Digital literacy', 'Computer literacy', 'Machine 
Learning literacy' and even 'Algorithmic literacy' (Ridley and Pawlick -Potts"
"2021a; Digital2030 2022; Druga et al. 2019a; Carlson and Johnston 2015) . 
We will come back to these names shortly. These literacies have two classes 
of potential students: library staff, and the patrons of libraries (i.e. the"
"public at large , or students and researche rs in colleges and unive rsities ). 
Then we may make a distinction between 'internal' (which here means 
'intellectual') and 'external' (which here means 'social', understanding 
'social' in a wide sense). So, for example, a person has AI literacy at an"
"internal level if they understand many of the kinds of AI software programs 
and possibly could even write them. Roughly, this would be college level 
knowledge (or 'competencies') that include some AI or computer science"
"courses. AI literacy at an external level requires knowledge of the settings 
or societal contexts in which AI is used, for good or for bad, and a 
reasonable grasp of how AI affects their own lives and that of societies as a 
whole.  Even children can be AI literate, at an external level."
"Back to the labels. We favor 'AI literacy'. ML is where the action is, but 
'Machine Learning literacy' is a mouthful. Neither 'Digital ' nor 'Computer 
literacies ' are entirely accurate. 'Algorithmic literacy' is unfortunate. It"
"smears the word 'algorithm' into a meaning it does not have, and then"
"357 exhorts us to be literate about a topic that it does not itself define correctly. 
Nevertheless, no doubt 'Algorithmic literacy' will gain ascendance in the 
marketplace for labels. At which point we will go with the flow. Anyway, it"
"is the external  versions of the literacies that librarians need to learn 
themselves and teach to others.  
 
There is a literature on teaching machine learning. For example, the 
delightfully titled 'Can You Teach Me To Machine Learn?' (Sulmont,"
"Patitsas, and Cooperstock 2019) . See also (Nori et al. [2019] 2023; Druga et 
al. 2019a) . The literature, though, is sparse , and the domain unexplored.  It 
is not really known how to do it well. For librarians and libraries, probably"
"hands on workshops , tutorials, and coding classes  would be a good idea.  
 
We have dealt with many of the components of AI literacy elsewhere, under 
different headings. But just to list  many  of the topics  
 
• Algorithms and how they work"
"• Having a critical understanding of AI tools  (for example, the ones 
mentioned in Chapter 5)  and the information that they may provide  
• Bias  
• Privacy . Teaching people to understand how to protect their privacy 
in the context of machine learning is important. Also important is"
"understanding the privacy policies of ML companies and ML 
applications.  
• Facial recognition technology  
• Research guidance Librarians could guide researchers in using 
machine learning tools to analyze their data. This could include"
"358 providing advice on the appropriate algorithms to use, helping to 
interpret the results, and ensuring that the research is conducted 
ethically.  
• Social epistemology  
 
13.3 Data Information Literacy ( for Producers  of 
Information )"
"There is the topic of 'Data Information Literacy' (Data Information Literacy 
Project 2023; Carlson and Johnston 2015) . Jake Carlson and Lisa Johnston 
ask: 
  
… what data management and curation skills are needed by future 
scientists to fulfill their professional responsibilities and take"
"advantage of collaborative research opportunities in e -science and 
technology -driven research environments? …. how can academic 
librarians apply their expertise in information retrieval, 
organization, dissemination, and preservation to teaching these"
"competencies to students? (Carlson and Johnston 2015, 2)  
 
Roughly, researchers need to curate their data i n such a way that the data is 
available to other researchers  and society at large . Also, for example, 
funding sources such as the National Science Foundation require a Data"
"Management Plan for research that they support. This is an ideal area for 
cooperation between librarians and researchers. This time the librarians 
are helping the researchers as producers of information, not as users of 
information. Only a part of this general area involves, or might involv e,"
"machine learning. But some of it may well do. Lisa Johnston and Jon 
Jeffryes discuss a case where civil engineering students put sensors on"
"359 bridges to learn of the integrity of the bridges  (Johnston and Jeffryes 2015) . 
That challenge may well involve machine learning. As noted earlier, 
machine learning data, say for supervised learning, needs to be of a certain 
kind and style.  
 
13.4 Changes in Learning and Teaching"
"Teaching and learning are changing in colleges and universities, 
particularly in areas like law and business. If curricula change, then there 
will need to be changes in libraries. Likely l earning will  become more 
personalized . If so, there will be learning data and analytics both of"
"individual students , of instructors,  and of groups and classes. Library use 
data will be part of this.  There are initiatives on the use of AI in Teaching 
and Learning (see, for example, (Office of Educational Technology 2023) ) 
 
13.5 Scholarly Communication"
"Jason Priem argues in his paper 'Beyond the paper ' that :  
 
The journal and article are being superseded by algorithms that 
filter, rate and disseminate scholarship as it happens . (Priem 
2013)  
 
This is an interesting and important paper. Priem , writing in 2013, locates"
"many of the changes and possibilities for change in the Web and what the 
Web enables (for example, share early share often, filter, and crowdsource  
review). We could not agree more with the general thesis, but now we"
"360 would locate the causal factors more with machine learning and LLMs. AI 
has the potential to remove peer review and possibly even many traditional 
journals.  
 
13.6 Academic Libraries Collaborating with other 
University Units"
"Academic libraries do this already. But ML is going to bring about big 
changes in teaching and research.  
 
The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions 
(IFLA)'s 2020 Statement on Libraries and Artificial Intelligence (IFLA"
"2020, 14)  mentions as example collaborations Stanford University Library 
AI Studio, the University of Rhode Island 's AI lab in the University Library, 
and the University of Cincinnati Libraries' Digital Scholarship Center  (see 
also (McKenzie 2018) )."
"A surprise is how few collaborations there seem to be. Most colleges or 
Universities have a Data Science department or school. All Universities 
have their libraries. Yet the visible collaborations can be counted on the 
fingers of one hand.  
 
13.7 AI Laboratories in the Library"
In 2017 -8 the University of Rhode Island  placed  an AI lab in its library :
"361 The library, as an interdisciplinary space that values inclusivity, is 
the ideal place for people of all backgrounds to learn about AI [ .	.	.] 
Unlike a typical AI lab focused on research, the URI AI Lab will 
offer students and instructors the chance to learn new computing"
"skills, and also encourage them to deepen their understanding of 
AI and how it might a ffect their lives, through a series of talks and 
workshops. The lab will o ffer beginner - to advanced -level tutorials 
in areas such as robotics, natural language processing, smart"
"cities, smart homes, the internet of things, and big data (McKenzie 
2018) . 
 
Putting the lab in the University ’s library is strategic. Organizers 
hope that students majoring in di fferent fields, from philosophy 
and ethics to computer science and biomedical engineering, will"
"visit the lab and use it to brainstorm about important social and 
ethical issues today and create cutting -edge projects (Rhody 
Today 2017) . 
 
The experiences of the AI lab, up until 2022, are described in (Dekker, 
Ferria, and Mandal 2022) . It seems that there has been such a demand for"
"the AI lab, and for Data Science as a whole campus wide, that the 
University is considering its options.  
 
13.8 Automated Decision -Making  
 
The European Union  (EU)  has a Generalized Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR), (summarized in (Wolford 2018) ). It is a law  which applies to and"
"protects EU citizens worldwide. It came into effect in 2018. Of particular 
interest to us is Article  22, which in part reads:"
"362 Art. 22 GDPR  
Automated individual decision -making, including 
profiling  
1. The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a 
decision based solely on automated processing, including 
profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or"
"similarly significantly affects him or her.  
2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the decision  <further  text 
omitted here> (GDPR 2018)  
 
'Profiling' , in GDPR,  means : 
… “any form of automated processing of personal data consisting"
"of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects 
relating to a natural person”  
Thus profiling should be construed as a subset of processing, 
under two conditions: the processing is automated, and the 
processing is for the purposes of evaluation  (Goodman and 
Flaxman 2017) ."
"Article 22, in the context of surrounding text and definitions : 
… restrict [s] automated individual decision -making (that is, 
algorithms that make decisions based on user -level predictors) 
which “significantly affect” users. The law … also effectively"
"create [s] a “right to explanation,” whereby a user can ask for an 
explanation of an algorithmic decision that was made about them  
(Goodman and Flaxman 2017, 1) .  
 
European law is European law, of course. But , nevertheless , GDPR  is the"
"result of deep consideration and analysis . It highlights the need for caution 
with use of personal data to produce decisions that affect people and the 
need for explanations of individual decisions that are made.  
 
Automated Decision -Making  (ADM),  using data about people as input and"
"producing decisions that affect people as output , has been around for a very 
long time. For example… The Constitution of the United States requires"
"363 that there be a census every 10 years. The results of this census determine 
how many seats each State has in the House of Representatives  (among 
other things) . Processing data on this scale used to be  a nightmare."
"Processing the 1880 census took eight years (Roberts 2019, 100)  In 1889 , 
Herman Hollerith received a patent for the ' Art of compiling statistics'. It 
was a patent  for the punched car d. 
 
A hole is thus punched corresponding to person, then a hole"
"according as person is a male or female, another recording 
whether native or foreign born, another either white or colored, 
&c. (Hollerith 1889)  
 
The data about each individual person was entered on a single card as 
punched holes. But then the data could be aggregated by running through"
"the cards and using an electro -mechanical device to detect the relevant 
holes. The data also could be 'combined' across categories. For example, 
were you to have an interest in white female carpenters it was essentially 
trivial in principle to determine how many there were (in a region, or a"
"State, or, indeed, in the United States). Hollerith cards were taken up by 
wider businesses , and commercial concerns , and the processing techniques 
led directly to the formation of IBM  (and the standard IBM 80 column 
punched card ). Hollerith, and his card, won the 1889 Bureau of the Census"
"competition to mechanize the process of conducting the Census. The 1890 
Census was automated.  
 
Thus, there has been ADM for a while, maybe for a hundred and thirty 
years. You can see the strengths and weaknesses of this original automation"
of the Census. It makes viable a very difficult practical problem. There
"364 should be few or no errors in the actual processing  of the stacks of punched 
cards . Additionally, the actual processing is completely transparent and, in 
principle, could be inspected by anyone. But the data needs to be sound. If"
"the data entry for an individual punches a hole for 'farmer' when the 
individual is actually a 'carpenter' , garbage is part of the input and the 
results of that garbage -in potentially can appear in the output, as garbage -
out. Even worse if groups of people are not even included, or properly"
"represented in the census, there certainly could be bias or unfairness in 
what comes out.  
 
Nowadays, ADM has spread far and wide. Not all such decisions involve 
data about people as input, not all directly affect people as output. Not all"
"involve machine learning. In fact , probably machine learning forms a 
relatively small, but increasing, part of ADM. After all, powerful machine 
learning has been available only for maybe 5 -10 years.  
 
Here are some examples  where machine learning may place a role in ADM :"
"• Autopilots on airplanes (and similar technologies on ships, 
trains, and motor vehicles ) 
• Many decisions in the financial realm (such as investing, the 
identification of suspect financial transactions , credit card, or 
mortgage eligibility (and what interest rates those eligible are"
"entitled to) .) 
• Medicine ( identification of possible positive indicators of skin or 
breast cancer)  
• The behaviors of industrial robots"
"365 • Military (robotics on the battlefield including unmanned systems  
and vehicles  of various kinds)  
• Providing evidential input to sentencing decisions in criminal 
trials  
• Various decisions involving employment (e.g. interviews, 
promotions, remedial interventions)"
"• Making suitable chess moves to be a companionable  opponent or 
to be a tutor of the appropriate level  
• And many many more  
 
Some of these types of decision making involve partnerships with humans. 
Humans may have overrides, may make the final choice or decision, etc."
"The strengths and weaknesses here are similar to those of the original 
Census automation. But there are differences. Many of the systems , or their 
intellectual aspects,  are owned by private companies, sometimes very large"
"companies. A result of this is that often the systems are proprietary and are 
'trade secrets'. With this, transparency can disappear. Outsiders may have 
no way of being assured that the actual processing is sound. When it comes"
"to machine learning, and large language models, for example, e ven the 
companies and their researchers can be in a position of  not really knowing 
how their complex systems work  (if, indeed, they do work) . In this case,"
"transparency is not being hidden by companies, it is simply not available.  A 
factor here is that large language models, for example,  are so expensive to 
establish that only the largest companies or the government have the 
resources to create them and do research with them. Universities do not"
"have the money  to become involved directly. In many fields, on e thinks of"
"366 universities as being  able to be  qualified and intelligent honest out side 
agents. But this is not true for advanced machine learning.  The universities 
cannot participate at all at a core level.  Then there is an important"
"difference regarding the data. In immigration controls in airports, and 
similar, the government uses machine -learning face recognition technology 
to scan the incoming crowds for 'persons of interest'. The government does 
not seek anyone's approval or consent to do this. This is similar to"
"gathering the original Census data  back in 1890 . There is a social contract 
between members of the community or society that gives implicit consent 
from members of that society to their government to carry out various 
governmental tasks and procedure s. But the situation with private"
"companies  is different . If you walk into a shopping mall and the mall scans 
your face, without your knowledge or informed consent, how is this right or 
ethically appropriate? In sum, attention needs to be paid to transparency"
"and the uses of data.  There is a lack of insight, a lack of transparency, and 
often a lack of informed consent. Putting this right perhaps falls to many 
parties: to the creators of the systems, to the makers of laws, to educators,"
"and to the citizenry at large.  Several countries, or groups of countries, do 
have laws. For example , as we have seen,  there is the European GDPR.  The 
USA does not have a relevant all -encompassing laws.  Librarians certainly"
"can play a role  (Ridley and Pawlick -Potts 2021a) . Assume so, what can they 
do? 
 
The librarians can become knowledgeable themselves. The M asters of 
Library and Information Science (MLIS)  degree, which is the 'union card'"
"for advancement in professional librarianship , might include a courses in 
the wider aspects of machine learning . (None do,  2023,  in the USA .)"
"367 Libraries, as institutions, can offer opportunities to their staff to increase 
their knowledge in this area. This might include courses, workshops, hands 
on sessions.  Then the librarians might be alert to inform their patrons"
"(about surveillance, consent, privacy, automatic decision making, etc.).  
 
13.9 Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)  
 
There is a research field, Explainable Artificial Intelligence  (XAI) , that has 
direct relevance to automated decision making. Exposure to the ideas of"
"Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)  is of benefit to folk trying to 
educate others about machine learning.  
 
Explainable AI is Machine Learning that has the property of being 
easily understood by humans  (Wikipedia 2023e)  ."
"What  ML systems can tell us is that certain observable features , feature -
data, are connected with other observable labels, label -data — for example, 
that being written by J.K. Rowling is correlated with being a popular book."
"Sometimes an ML  system  will tell us the labels , the predictions,  without 
being able to tell us of the specific features  that it used in its inference  or 
calculation . In these cases, the  ML system  is a black box. You give it a book,"
"the features of a book, and  it will tell you if the book will be popular.  It is an 
Oracle.  (Hence forward , here,  as an abbreviation, 'Oracle MLs' .) 
 
At this point we will take a brief detour into two areas of philosophy: the 
philosophy of knowledge , epistemology,  and the philosophy of"
understanding  and explanation .
"368  
We want to distinguish knowledge from right opinion . This is a distinction 
from Plato’s Meno, amplified by John Stuart Mill’s work on freedom of 
speech  (Plato 380AD; Mill 1869) . (Nowadays, 'right opinion'  would"
"probably be more usual ly describe d as being 'true belief'. ) Plato defined 
knowledge as having three components:  
 
Knowledge needs to be true.  
It needs to be believed.  
It needs to be justified.  
 
An Oracle  ML might provide right opinion, but it does not give knowledge."
"For knowledge, the knower has to have evidence and be able to provide a 
reasoned defense, or explanation, or justification of the known.  In brief, the 
knower has to be able to give the reasons why.  Socrates argue d: 
 
…true opinions: while  they abide with us they are beautiful and"
"fruitful, but they run away out  of the human soul, and do not 
remain long, and therefore they are not of  much value until they 
are fastened by the tie of the cause …when they are bound … they 
have the nature of  knowledge; and  … they are abiding. And this is"
"why  knowledge is more honourable and excellent than true 
opinion, because fastened  by a chain  (Plato 380AD, 98) . 
 
An Oracle does not give knowledge.  It does not give causes.  
 
Then, what , in this context,  is understanding?  
 
A simple but plausible answer given by contemporary"
"philosophers of science is as follows: to understand a 
phenomenon is to grasp how the phenomenon is caused  (Strevens 
2013) ."
"369  
The phenomena of interest here is how the successful ML systems produce 
the correct predictions that they do. To understand, we need to know the 
causes at work. With Oracles, the causes are exactly what we do not have."
"Hence,  to address these considerations,  there is  the existence of the 
research field Explainable AI (XAI) , with its own techniques and methods. 
Space does not permit extended discussion here of XAI.  
 
There are actually two causal problems with Oracles. There is the problem"
"of specific predictions, understanding why a specific prediction has been 
made in a particular case, and there is the problem of understanding how a 
given Oracle works  as a whole  inside its black box. An example of the first"
"problem is when a radiologist works in partnership with an ML system to 
assess a patient and to diagnose possible cancer. The radiologist (and the 
patient) need to know the basis of, or evidence for, the ML system's 
prediction. The reason for that need is that knowledge is better than right"
"opinion.  Knowledge is better for trust,  ethics, respect for human beings,  
decision making, regulatory and legal requirements, etc. An example of the 
second problem is that the designers or programmers of the radiology 
image diagnosis system should understand how it works. That would help"
"them going forward to assess and improve the system (Strevens 2013) . 
 
Elsewhere, we do negotiate our lives using correlations  (right opinions) . 
The farmer puts fertilizer on crops, we take aspirin for headaches, and a"
"majority of us avoid smoking for health reasons. Some of these connections 
are undoubtedly causal. But we usually do not know of the details of the 
causality. Often, this is the best we can do. The phenomena, the laws, if"
"370 there are any, the initial conditions, and the interactions of these, are all 
intertwined and complex.  Often , they are also probabilistic.  Basically , the 
systems  are close to being  black boxes. If XAI can do as well as agriculture 
and medical science, that might be good enough."

"372 Chapter 14: Librarians as Managers  
 
14.1 Coming on Board  
 
Libraries need management, and many librarians have management duties. 
Of course, they are usually assisted in these duties by computers and 
general library automation. The use of AI or ML in this setting would be a"
"step further. Amanda Wheatley and Sandy Hervieux's have published an 
environmental scan of the use of AI in academic libraries (Wheatley and 
Hervieux 2019) . 
 
Their appraisal is bleak. Here are some quotations from the Wheatley and 
Hervieux paper, offered without comment or judgement:"
"What is perhaps the library’s best kept secret has been its slow 
uptake on automation and digital technologies .  
 
[On the possibility of libraries being run by machines] This 
unsettling reality should have awoken librarians, instead the"
"profession reacted as it did to most technological revolutions - it 
waited. In fact, it is still waiting . 
 
The absence of scholarly research on AI -related technologies in 
libraries is not to be unexpected. Libraries have suffered from"
"issues on the adoption of digital technologies and a general 
resistance to change throughout the twentieth and twenty -first 
centuries . 
 
The progression of industrial and office automation paved the way 
for libraries to adopt similar technology, yet this adoption was"
always years behind the current trends.
"373 The current state of artificial intelligence in academic libraries has 
proven to be nearly non -existent.  
 
Separately from this environmental scan, there are literature reviews that 
range wider than academic libraries. Rajesh Das and Mohammad Islam, in"
"their systematic literature review of the application of AI and ML in 
libraries, identify in the publications the following ten themes (R. K. Das 
and Islam 2021) : 
 
• collection building and management,  
• processing in libraries,  
• circulation and user studies,  
• reference service,"
"• library administration,  
• library customization and retrieval,  
• research and scholarship,  
• service quality and innovation,  
• intelligent agents for information search and retrieval,  
• study on implementation and existing technologies and solution"
"Their review is backward looking, of necessity . It is considering what has 
been done (prior to 2020) and what AI and ML techniques were used to do 
it. 
 
There is also Andrew Cox, Stephen Pinfield, and Sophie Rutter's The"
"intelligent library: Thought leaders’ views on the likely impact of artificial 
intelligence on academic libraries  (Cox, Pinfield, and Rutter 2019) . This"
"374 does have valuable content — its editorial summary is excellent . But it is old, 
and it is not clear how well informed the 33 'thought leaders' were around 
2018. One of them did not know what Artificial Intelligence was, and none"
"of them knew about large language models (nor did the rest of us).  
 
IFLA  is The International Federation of Library Associations and 
Institutions. It styles itself as 'the Global Voice of the Library and 
Information Profession' . Its 2022 Trend Report Update has no mention of"
"artificial intelligence or machine learning (Al Badi et al. 2023) . IFLA does 
have its earlier Statement on Libraries and Artificial Intelligence , which is 
very good (IFLA 2020) .  
 
Barbara Wood and David Evans write in their paper Librarians’"
"Perceptions of Artificial Intelligence and Its Potential Impact on the 
Profession : 
 
The results of our survey point to an overwhelming sense of 
complacency among librarians in regard to the 
transformative/disruptive effects of this technology. For the past"
"35 years, academic libraries have successfully embraced 
computerization. Why is it that, at this time, we have our heads in 
the sand? We liken it to the climate change debate —the data is 
there, but we choose to ignore it  (Wood and Evans 2018) ."
"For us, i t is worthwhile for us to consider aspects of these themes which we 
have not considered elsewhere.  In Chapter 10 the following topics were 
mentioned  
 
• Workflow and Improving Service"
"375 • Optimize the Use of Space (and, Indeed, Other Resources)  
• Robots  
• Mimicking  Librarian Experts' Behaviors  
 
We are interested specifically in machine learning and artificial intelligence 
(not in plain automation).  We are using the (R. K. Das and Islam 2021)  as"
"the skeleton for this.  
 
14.2 Data and Analyses  
 
There will be data on resources, processes, user behavior, and more. From 
these, there can be  
 
• Predictive Analytics  This identifies past usage patterns  and trends  
as input to predict demand  and need . It could be looking at many"
"types of data as input ( demographics, time of day,  time of year (e.g. 
exams, summer breaks) ). With machine learning it does not really 
matter how rich or apparently irrelevant the types  of data . After 
training, a nything known that is not connected with the correlations"
"will just be given weight zero (i.e. discounted).  
• User Behavior Analy tics. This is data on what the patrons are 
doing, either individually or collectively. Attention needs to be given 
here to privacy or informed consent. Anonymous data, for example on"
"which  books are frequently checked out, can help with decisions on 
which books to keep physically in the stacks and which to store 
elsewhere, perhaps off -site. In contrast, recommendation systems will"
"376 work better with information tied to patrons individually (that still 
can be kept anonymous).  
• Learning Analytics . In cases where libraries are serving students, 
faculty, and research, there can be data on what resources the patrons"
"use and how they use them  for the purposes of teaching and learning . 
In turn, this can be used to improve the process of education.  There is 
a large and burgeoning field Artificial Intelligence in Education 
(AIED) . See, for example, (Stanford HAI 2023a) .) Librarianship will"
"have a role in this. That role will extend to School Libraries and 
Public Libraries.  
 
14.3 Evidence -Based  Librarianship  
 
When making decisions, e vidence -based practices encourage the use of the 
best available evidence, in conjunction with expertise and attention to"
"values (Wikipedia 2023d) . This approach tends to downplay tradition, 
especially when no -one knows why the tradition is as it is. There is 
Evidence -Based  Librar y and Information Practice  (EBLIP) , with  supporting  
books , research articles, and a journal  (for example, (Hjørland 2011;"
"University of Alberta Library 2023) . Maybe now is its time. There is now 
plenty of data, and ML can analyze a quantity  of it in a way that no human 
can.  Of course, the management and administration of libraries used any 
amount of data prior to the advent of EBLIP. But now there is much more"
"data and the existence of ML that can interact with that data intelligently. 
As mentioned many times, ML can deal with volume in a way that collective 
human resources cannot."
"377 14.4 Data -Driven Decision Making  
 
14.4.1 Collection Building and Management  
 
ML can analyze the collection and its use s. Predictive Analytics can be used 
as part input on decisions on which materials to purchase, keep in the"
"collection, or weed or discard.  It can help with resource allocation. The 
analysis would take input from availability of materials in other libraries, or 
the needs of the library's users.  (See  (Litsey and Mauldin 2018) .) 
 
14.4.2 Circulation and User S tudies"
"Service, recommendation, personalization, and AIED all have relevance 
here. ML together with the data analytics mentioned earlier have the 
potential to effect improvements.  
 
14.4.3 Processing in Libraries  
 
AI can help with many of the processes that are part of librarianship. Most"
"of these have been mentioned earlier in this text, including cataloguing, 
classification, acquisition , archiving, digitization, transcription, translation, 
indexing , and summarization."
"378 14.4.4 Research and Scholarship  
 
The view here is  that shortly the information discovery techniques and tools 
are going to be far superior to the ones we have today. We have amplified 
on this thesis  throughout this text. What managers should do is to support 
the use of these tools."
"14.4.5 Service Quality  
 
There will be improved metrics on most aspects of service. Being able to 
measure how good service is does not of itself guarantee good service. But 
whenever insights or innovations come to the fore, it is good to know 
whether they actually do make service better."
"14.5 Acquiring the Appropriate AI Tools  
 
The managers can acquire the relevant AI tools.  
 
IFLA makes a suggestion  that would  kill another bird with that stone : 
 
Libraries can also support ethical AI research and development by"
"their procurement choices: purchasing AI technologies which 
abide by ethical standards of privacy and inclusivity. This would 
both reaffirm the trust of users in libraries, and send a message to 
the AI research field by increasing the demand for ethical AI 
technologies  (IFLA 2020, 2) ."
"379  
14.6 Analysts  and Staff  
 
There is a shortage of skills and awareness . 
 
The demands of responding to such changes may reveal a 
significant skills gap in the sector. We know there is already strong 
demand in the economy for data scientists for data analysis and"
"visualisation. Perhaps some librarians will be required to develop 
these skills, or at least awareness of different techniques and how 
they need to be supported. These demands are a challenge 
because they prompt librarians to learn more about IT and"
"quantitative data analysis, including statistics. In a relatively low -
paid sector we may be unlikely to attract people with stronger 
STM backgrounds to the profession, while those in the profession 
are typically from an arts background. More optimistically, we can"
"say there will also be a need for librarians as data curators to take 
on new data  (Cox, Pinfield, and Rutter 2019, 17)   
 
Foundation  Models have given us all a break here. You do not have to be a 
programmer or a mathematician to use, develop, or configure LLMs. You"
"can even be from an 'arts background'. So -called 'Prompt Engineering' 
makes many things possible — we will look further into that in Appendix B. 
 
14.7 Fear of AI  
 
Within the library profession there does seem to be a fear of AI (as"
"evidence, see, for example, (Cox, Pinfield, and Rutter 2019; ExLibris 
2019) )."
"380 ExLibris invites us  librarians to be  Liberty Leading the People  (Wikipedia 
2023h) : 
 
… embracing AI not as users, but as active players to fight the risks 
of bias, misuse, and discrimination If libraries take an active role"
"in the implementation of artificial intelligence applications in the 
information management landscape, then they can help 
programmers find the best data for their algorithms. Once they 
assume the leading role, librarians can be co -creators of ""an"
"intelligent information system that respects the sources, engages 
critical inquiry, fosters imagination, and supports human learning 
and knowledge creation,"" according to Catherine Nicole Coleman. 
AI solutions can also facilitate both more process transparency"
"and greater data control, with libraries able to safeguard their 
most important principles and maintain trust, neutrality, freedom 
of expression, mindful media consumption, and equal access to 
information, while promoting digital inclusion and data privacy"
"""Advocacy should not be directed at maintaining traditional 
librarianship, but in influencing the development of the emerging 
information systems.""

Chapter 1 5: Librarians as Astronauts  
 
15.1 Astronaut Training  
 
Well, you are in a good place. To do creative work with Foundation Models, 
you do not need to know anything about machine learning, or computer 
programming. You do not even have to have any domain knowledge about"
"the area you are going to work in (which we are assuming here to be 
librarianship). The Foundation Model you use will have all the knowledge 
that is required. Your role is to ask it in ordinary natural language — to 
'prompt' it — to do whatever you are looking for.  Over the past twenty years"
"or so many librarians have become absolute experts at using search 
engines, say Google Search. Now there are new kid s on the block, 
Foundation Models , Large Language Models  or Large Multimodal Models . 
It would not be a bad thing at all for many librarians to become absolute"
"experts at LLMs  or LMMs . 
 
15.2 Why Should You Learn How To Do It ? 
 
• Gives you understanding  
• Allows you to teach others  
• Allows you to produce apps.  
• Allows you to work with ML professionals"
"382 15.3 What are the Real Creative Possibilities  
 
This is hard to know  (stating the obvious ). Three areas where modern 
machine learning might have a distinction advantage over the incumbents 
in librarianship or in information curation and provision are: data"
"visualization, chatbots, and information discovery including  text data 
mining.  
 
Data science — making sense of data — is important. Having the right 
representation of the data is often critical to understanding that data and"
"seeing how to reason with it. The key point was made by Jill Larkin and 
Herbert Simon  in their paper Why a diagram is (sometimes) worth ten 
thousand words . They suggest that informational equivalence should be 
distinguished from computational equivalence  (Larkin and Simon 1987) ."
"The distinction can be explained by means of an illustration.  
 
Donald Norman dr ew attention to a famous example of two games  
(Norman 1993) . In the first : 
 
you and your opponent take turns in choosing and selecting 
single, previously untaken, numbers in the range 1..9, and the"
"winner of the game is the first  person who has 3 numbers that 
sum to 15. [So you try both to get numbers that sum to 15 and also 
to prevent your opponent from getting such numbers.]  
 
In the second : 
 
you play Tic -Tac-Toe (or Noughts and Crosses),"
"383 Now, the first game we would find awkward and might lose from time to 
time (until we devised a suitable representational scheme). The second is 
trivial, and an attentive adult would never lose a game. But the two games"
"are the same. They are different representations of the same game. If the 
numbers are laid out as though they were on a Tic -Tac-Toe board : 
 
6 1 8  
7 5 3  
2 9 4  
 
Then the problem of finding three numbers that sum to 15 is exactly that of"
"finding three in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line.  
 
Any information as to the board's state, or to the numbers selected, is 
exactly inter -translatable back and forth between Tic -Tac-Toe 
representation and numbers -selected representation. There is information"
"equivalence. But humans can manipulate and compute with one 
representation much more easily than the other. (And, interestingly 
enough, a computer, or a computer program, would be more at home with 
the numeric representation as opposed to the two -dimensional board 
representation.)"
"Information opens up different possibilities for an agent depending on how 
it is represented. This is matter of the manipulations, operations , and 
computations , that the depiction facilitates.  (A good collection of historical"
depictions of statistical data can be found in Michael Friendly's Gallery of
"384 Data Visualization  (Friendly 2007) .) Machine learning may well be able to 
learn the best ways to represent data.  
 
Let us sketch some territories here. In so far as this concerns diagrams, as it 
would for education and for research by humans, the area of interest is"
"cognitive psychology and heuristics. In so far as it concerns computer 
processing, it would be a matter of data -structures and algorithms — parts 
of computer science. Librarians may be fine with either of these, but they 
are a little outside librarians' bailiwick."
"Chatbots have been discussed extensively in this text . Certainly , chatbots in 
libraries represent an opportunity, possibly even a research opportunity. 
But chatbots for the purpose of service are going to be everywhere. It may 
be hard for librarian developers to keep themselves clear of the"
"development stampede.  
 
Information discovery  and text data mining are both gifts to librarians. 
Librarians know from text. We will amplify shortly on one aspect of this 
possibility.  
 
15.4 Sitting in Your Tin Can"
"If you are going to sit in your tin can, you could think about how ML might 
provide new ways to interact with library resources. You could think about 
interactive games and simulations that might help with access or with AI 
literacy. You could think about many things."

15.5 Exploring World 3  
 
15.5.1 Undiscovered Public Knowledge (UPK)  
 
In 1986  Don Swanson wrote as the abstract to his paper Undiscovered 
Public Knowledge : 
 
Knowledge  can be  public, yet  undiscovered, if independently 
created fragments are logically related but never retrieved,"
"brought together, and interpreted. Information retrieval, although 
essential for assembling such fragments, is always problematic. 
The search process, like a scientific theory, can be criticized and 
improved, but can never be verified as capable of retrieving all"
"information relevant to a problem or theory. This essential 
incompleteness of search and retrieval therefore makes possible, 
and plausible, the existence of  undiscovered public knowledge. 
Three examples intended to throw light on the logic"
"of undiscovered knowledge  are constructed and analyzed. The 
argument is developed within the framework of a Popperian or 
critical approach within science and on Popper's distinction 
between subjective and objective  knowledge --the distinction 
between World 2 and World 3.  (Swanson 1986)"
"The refer enced  work of Karl Popper can be explained thus. Popper had 
introduced in the idea of three worlds : World 1 (the physical world), World 
2 (the mental world), and World 3  ('… the world of objective contents of"
"thought, especially of scientific and poetic thoughts and of works of art. '). 
World 3 — objective knowledge — contains the contents  of books and 
libraries, not the physical books (World 1), nor the mental ideas conjured"
"386 up by the books (World 2), but the contents of the books understood as the 
objective assertions they make.  (See  Epistemology Without a Knowing 
Subject  (Popper 1968) .) World 3 objects can stand in logical relations one"
"to another.  One book may contain the assertion 'Leda is a swan'. Another 
book may contain the assertion 'All swans are white'. Those two books 
together, considered as a combined whole, entail the consequence that Leda 
is white. Swanson instantiated and generalized this in the following way."
"Suppose (some recorded research tells that) process  A causes effect B and 
(some entirely different recorded research tells that) B causes effect C then 
A causes C, and this , perhaps hitherto unknown,  relationship can be 
discovered by looking at the recorded research.  This is an example of"
"Undiscovered Public Knowledge  (UPK) . A real scientific example that 
Swanson offered from 1986 is that it was known, as recorded objective 
knowledge , that (A)  fish oil reduces platelet clumping (B) and reduced 
platelet clumping is (C) of benefit to patients with Raynaud's disease. But it"
"was not known as objective knowledge (i.e. published anywhere as recorded 
knowledge) that (A) fish oil can be (C) of benefit to patients with Raynaud's 
disease.  That relationship can be discovered without entering a laboratory. 
It can be discovered without leaving a library."
"[Usually] …. different assertions and findings need to be 
assembled across documents to create a new coherent assertion, 
much as different pieces of a puzzle are assembled to create a 
single picture. (Smalheiser 2017, 3)"
"We should keep in mind here that all knowledge is fallible and conjectural. 
So that when we appear to discover that fish oil helps with Raynaud's 
disease, we are discovering a new conjecture, that apparently no one had"
"387 proposed earlier , and that conjecture would need testing.  If its components 
had been thoroughly tested and were reliable, it may be that further testing 
could be minimal. That would depend in part on what the practical"
"consequences would be of trusting the hypothesis. In the case of medical 
treatments, and drugs, there are established protocols.  
 
It may be that the apparent conjecture from UPK had been known and 
discovered earlier. Researchers looking for treatments for Raynaud's"
"disease may have had hundreds of conjectures as to what might be suitable, 
and their problem might have been how to spend their time and money. In 
this case, the ABC example given above screams loudly: try fish oil. UPK is 
still valuable."
"There are other kinds of UPK (Smalheiser 2017) . There can be publications 
that no one currently reads. These may be publications in truly obscure 
journals, or in outlets that retrieval systems have trouble in finding 
(perhaps due to poor indexing or metadata) ."
"Investigators in these areas often talk of one node, or two node, searches or 
of open, or closed, searches. If the search starts with process A and is trying 
to find anything it relates to, that would be a one node, or open, search. If"
"the search starts with two processes A and C, and is trying to find a B that 
connects them, that would be a two node, or closed, search.

Graduate Library School of the University of Chicago.]"

15.5.2 Literature -Based Discovery (Text Based Informatics)  
 
The seminal work of Don Swanson has been generalized and developed to 
form  Literature -Based Discovery  (sometimes called Text Based 
Informatics ). This is used widely in bioinformatics and medical"
"informatics. See, for example, (Crichton et al. 2020; Heatley 2023; Moreau 
2023; Sebastian, Siew, and Orimaye 2017; Thilakaratne, Falkner, and 
Atapattu 2020; Wikipedia 2023j) . 
 
A consideration of importance to us is that Literature -Based Discovery until"
"about 2020 used what we now would regard as being primitive bibliometric 
tools . Computers were used, and Google -style searches.  It used authors, 
titles, keywords, subject headings, etc. But 2023 machine learning, 
especially LLMs, open up new possibilities. No doubt, UPK researchers are"
"on to LLMs already. But the target domain is vast — every book in every 
library. There are opportunities for all.  
 
15.5.3 A Message to Librarian Astronauts  
The growth of scientific knowledge is usually thought of in terms 
of wresting new discoveries  from the physical world — World 1 —"
"admittedly a world that offers unlimited opportunity for 
discovery. But it should be of interest to librarians to notice that 
World 3 also qualifies as an endless frontier and  to understand 
how and why this is so  (Swanson 1986, 117)"

"390 Appendix A : Some Theoretical Background to 
Librarianship  
 
A.1 Concepts, Classification, Taxonomies, and Items  
 
A central component of classification is concepts, and a whole collection of 
concepts, being used at once, amount to a taxonomy  or conceptual scheme"
"or classification scheme . A concept has intension  (meaning) and extension 
(which is the collection , or class, or set,  of those items , or individuals, or 
things,  in the world that fall under it , or are instances of it ). Concepts will"
"usually have labels  (i.e. words, or names) that identify them. Some concepts 
can have two or more different labels — such labels would be synonyms e.g. 
'attorney' and 'lawyer'. Some labels can label two different concepts — such"
"labels would be homographs e.g. 'bank' (of river) and 'bank' (financial 
institution).  
 
There is a general looseness of terminology in classification areas. The 
terms 'concept', 'class', 'set', 'category', and probably other terms, can get"
"used interchangeably. We will go with the flow on this (for example, often 
using 'class' or 'set' for concept).  
 
A taxonomy — unless it is a simple list or dictionary — will always have at 
least one class which is a subclass of another class. The n the  overall"
"structure of the scheme might be a 'hierarchy ', a 'polyhierarchy ', a 'directed 
acyclic graph ', a 'tree', a 'forest of trees', or some other graph -theoretic 
structure  (see (Frické 2012) )."
"391  
A.2 Controlled Vocabularies, and Thesauri  
 
In many settings, librarianship will use Controlled Vocabularies  (CVs). A 
controlled vocabulary is collection of words, or 'terms', where the words are 
'controlled' — they have a fixed and definite form. As to the value of CVs,"
"Elaine Svenonius writes  
 
Perhaps as near as one can come to generalization about the value 
of a CV  is simply to say where precision and recall are important 
retrieval objectives, then a CV of some kind is mandated.   
(Svenonius 2003, 837)"
"[There are more detailed explanations of CVs, and their value, in (Frické 
2012; Harpring 2020; ANSI/NISO 2010; Zeng 2005) . CVs are still of value 
in the age of computers and machine learning as they provide a standard 
way to describe concepts and their relationships, and a standard interface"
"between different systems.]  
 
The simplest CVs amount to little more than lists of terms. CVs used for 
indexing and metadata (e.g. subject classification) tend to be more 
sophisticated than this. They have a structure in the background, with links"
"or connections between some terms. As an example, the Library of 
Congress Subjects Headings (LCSH) is a controlled vocabulary. LCSH has 
hundreds of thousands of terms in it, and it took a hundred years or more 
to build. It is probably the biggest and most elaborate CV ever made. Its"
size and m aturity are not the only points of interest. It also relates broader
"392 and narrower terms, and it suggests preferred terms in the case of 
synonyms.  
 
Indexes typically use CVs. Each hierarchy in an index -CV is a 'tree'.   But the 
index as a whole  is not a single tree . There is not one single term at the top"
"with every other term being a subterm of it. Rather there are several 
different trees. The structure is that of a  forest . For example, t he MESH 
subject heading s are in 16 different trees.  As an illustration, here are six of 
them  
 
• Anatomy  
• Organisms  
• Diseases"
"• Chemicals and Drugs  
• Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and 
Equipment  
• Psychiatry and Psychology  
 
Thesauri  are controlled vocabularies with relations provided between 
broader and narrower words or terms. However, some extant controlled"
"vocabularies themselves have broader and narrow terms (e.g. the 
aforementioned LCSH). If this practice is acceptable, Thesauri can be much 
the same as Controlled Vocabularies.  
 
A few words are in order about the nature of the links or relations between"
"the broader and narrower terms.  International standards for thesauri 
distinguish three possibilities here: subclass, instance, and part 
(ANSI/NISO 2010) . Whales are a subclass of mammals, Moby Dick is an 
instance of a whale, a blowhole is part of a whale. So, an imaginary CV"
"393 might contain: 'mammal' narrower term 'whale', 'whale' narrower term 
'Moby Dick, and 'whale' narrower term 'blowhole (whale)'. The first relation 
would be subclass (sometimes called 'generic'), the second instance, and the"
"third partitive. The first two relations can come under the general approach 
of taxonomies. The third, addressing parts, is usually considered to be 
mereology (which is the study of parts and wholes).  
 
We will usually assume that the collection of top -level  terms  in a thesaurus"
"(those that are not narrower terms of other broader terms)  could be 
printed, displayed, or written out in 'alphabetical' order. There is a small 
wrinkle here. Just what 'alphabetical' order amounts to is a question. To 
give an example, for a telephone directory, should 'Newark' come before"
"'New York, or after it? where should numbers go? where should foreign 
words go? where should abbreviations go? The practice here is known as 
the 'filing order', and it is a matter of several decisions or conventions  
(which we will not go into) . 
 
A.3 Ontologies and Ontological Vocabularies"
"An ontology identifies what exists in a certain domain or area i.e. the 
individuals, the properties, the classes, etc. As examples, a medical setting 
might have an ontology with doctors, patients, medicines, bacteria, etc. in"
"it. A soccer game might have players, teams, balls, referees, pitches, and the 
like. A library might have patrons, librarians, books, desks, reading rooms, 
and similar items. Computer scientists use ontologies as a guide to the"
"requisite data -structures needed for their programs. Libra rianship is not 
really interested in ontologies as such, but it is interested in the words or"
"394 terms that are used. An ontology will have terms or words associated with 
the items that appear. So, for example, in a soccer ontology, ‘pitch’, ‘field’, 
and ‘paddock’ are near synonyms for the surface on which the game is"
"played. Such terms could be built into a controlled vocabulary, with ‘pitch’ 
being the preferred term, and ‘field’ and ‘paddock’ being lead -in terms. A 
thesaurus could also easily be used here (e.g. with ‘soccer complex’ having"
"‘pitch’ as a narrower term). Ontologies themselves, or what we might call 
‘Ontological Vocabularies’, could also be used. For example, libraries lend 
books (or, perhaps, ‘libraries issue books’); we can make one of these forms"
"a preferred form and record in the Ontological Vocabulary that libraries 
lend books.  
 
Thus, Ontological Vocabularies, in so far as they provide relationships 
between words or terms, are a more general case than Thesauri. For"
"example, consider, in a medical setting, the relationships ‘… is a symptom 
of …’ , ‘… may be treated by …’ ; a relevant Ontological Vocabulary might 
have preferred terms for ‘headache’, ‘fever’, ‘influenza’, and ‘aspirin’, and 
also such relationships as ‘headache may be treated by aspirin’."
"If these possibilities are thought of in a graph -theoretic sense: a thesaurus 
links narrower terms to broader terms, and often the structure of this will 
amount to a tree i.e. there is a root, and parent nodes can have many 
children but each child can have only one parent. Some thesauri, for"
"example the LCSH, permit some terms to have more than one broader term 
(i.e. a child node might have more than one parent node) in which case the 
structure would be a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In an Ontological 
Voca bulary , any node might possibly be linked to any other node; this"
"395 would amount to a general graph (i.e. a web of nodes and links). Roughly, 
then, an ontology is a generalization of a taxonomy, and an ontological 
vocabulary is a generalization of a thesaurus.  
 
A.4 Objective, Intersubjective, and Subjective"
"These three terms are selectors among knowledge, or among candidates for 
knowledge. When an Art Historian describes a painting as being in the 
shape or proportions of a golden rectangle, she is picking out a property of 
the painting.  She is making a perfectly objective ascription about the"
"external world. She can be wrong, of course. There can be some mistake 
with her eyes or means of measurement. Nevertheless, right or wrong, she 
is aiming to be objective. Moving on, suppose her aesthetic is that of 
Neoclassicism, to the exclusion of all else. She may describe a painting by"
"Jacques -Louis David as being a good painting. That would be an 
intersubjective judgement. There are plenty of other Neoclassicists and they 
would have the same view. But Neoclassicism itself is not part of the 
external world, it is an aspect of a certain kind of culture. Finally, there is"
"the rest of us who know nothing about art but know what we like. 
Expressions of what we like would be subjective.  
 
Taxonomies also can be objective, intersubjective, or subjective. Objective 
schemes are the province of science and mathematics. Classifying matter"
"into atoms, elements, compounds, and mixtures, or classifying the numbers 
into integers, reals, or rational numbers, or classifying parts of the 
biological world into genus and species are all objective schemes. As noted 
earlier, our knowledge of the objective is fallible — scientists or"
"396 mathematicians can be mistaken (and hopefully they can correct the 
errors).  Intersubjective schemes arise in the context of society, culture, 
politics, religion, myths, and the law. A good example is the Nursing 
Interventions Classification (NIC)"
"[it] is a comprehensive, research -based, standardized 
classification of interventions that nurses perform.   It is useful for 
clinical documentation, communication of care across settings, 
integration of data across systems and settings, effectiveness"
"research, productivity measurement, competency evaluation, 
reimbursement, and curricular design …. 
 
The 565 interventions  in NIC (7th ed.) are grouped into thirty 
classes and seven domains for ease of use.   The 7 domains are: 
Physiological: Basic, Physiological: Complex, Behavioral, Safety,"
"Family, Health System, and Community.   Each intervention has a 
unique number (code).   The classification is continually updated 
with an ongoing process for feedback and review.   In the back of 
the book, there are instructions for how users can submit"
"suggestions for modifications to existing interventions or propose 
a new intervention  (Butcher et al. 2018) . 
 
This is not a description of the external world. This is not intended to tell us 
how the world is built (the continual updating is a bit a giveaway on this). It"
"is not objective (in our sense of objective). Rather it is a convenient fiction 
(or, as some might say, it is a social construction). However, nurses, 
doctors, insurance companies etc. all respect and use this fiction. It is"
"intersubjective. It is artifact they all agree on and use. As to the final 
category of pure subjective classification — that, for example, is how you 
and I separately organize our clothes in our wardrobes.  
 
Most classification schemes in information organization are inter -"
"subjective, but some have components that supervene on objective"
"397 classifications. For example, schemes for classification of resources on 
science or mathematics, e.g. books and research papers, would typically 
partially follow objective classifications that the scientists or 
mathematicians use.  
 
A.5 Emotive and Descriptive Content"
"Going back to the  Art Historian describ ing a painting as being in the shape 
or proportions of a golden rectangle … Being golden rectangular as a 
property is not something that is either good or bad, and it is not something"
"that she wants to recommend to you or to warn you away from. It is just a 
plain description. ‘ golden rectangular’ has descriptive content and little or 
no emotive content. When a viewer  describes a painting as being ‘nice’ or"
"‘good’, that viewer  is perhaps expressing approval or recommendation.  But 
it is unclear  what in particular, if anything, in the painting, ‘nice’ or ‘good’ 
describes. ‘Nice’ or ‘good’ have emotive content and little or no fixed"
"descriptive content. (Emotive content is sometimes called ‘connotation’.)  
 
Many adjectives (properties, nouns) have both some descriptive content 
and some emotive content. And it is possible for different words to have the"
"same descriptive content but different emotive content. For example, there 
are Bertrand Russell’s well -known ‘emotive conjugations’ [Comment, 
Brains Trust  (BBC Radio) (26 Apr 1948)] such as  
 
I am firm; you are obstinate; he is a pig -headed fool."
"I am righteously indignant; you are annoyed; he is making a fuss 
over nothing."
"398 We made a tactical withdrawal; our allies retreated; the enemy 
was routed.  
I have reconsidered; you have changed your mind; he has gone 
back on his word.  
 
Were the present author  to be described as 'firm', or as 'obstinate', or,"
"indeed, as 'a pig -headed fool', the descriptive or cognitive content of those 
ascriptions is exactly the same (we may suppose). That is the dispositions, 
and actual actions, of his that these concepts or labels pick out, if correctly"
"used, are identical for all three labels. However , the labels are intended to 
either express or evoke different sentiments on the part of the speaker or 
the listener. Roughly, at one end, a speaker that uses 'firm' is mildly"
"admiring of the trait and wishes the listener to be mildly admiring also; at 
the other end, well, we all know what labeling the author  'a pig -headed fool' 
is intended to achieve. These expressive or evocative functions are the"
"emotive content. So , each of the concepts [firm, obstinate, pig -headed] has 
pretty well the same descriptive content, the same intensions, but they 
differ in emotive content. They are synonyms in all but emotional force."
"Of course, both descriptive content and emotive content of particular labels 
or concepts can change through time and be different across cultures.  
 
For various reasons, usually obvious ones, individuals, groups, and"
"institutions often try to employ different labels or different classification 
schemes in order to manipulate the emotive -descriptive divide in a way 
they wish. For example, it may be that the label 'garbage collector' is a term"
"of mild opprobrium, and all concerned might switch to 'sanitary engineer' 
as the concept  or label  of choice. Here, the intensions of 'garbage collector'"
"399 and 'sanitary engineer' are pretty well the same, but one has unwanted 
emotional association.  [This move is usually a temporary palliative. Say folk 
do have bad feelings to, or opinions of, the profession of garbage"
"collection — those bad attitudes do not attach to the name rather they attach 
to what those garbage collectors are and to what they do. We are all familiar 
with Romeo and Juliet’s ‘What’s in a name? that which we call a rose By"
"any other name would smell as sweet;’. Using the label 'sanitary engineer' 
might work for a while, but give it 50 years and a person may be able to 
insult another with the words 'sanitary engineer'.]  
 
A.6 Classification Schemes and the Act of Classification"
"There are two balls that we are juggling here. There are the classification 
schemes, and there is the act of classification. Consider, for example, the 
aforementioned Nursing Intervention Classification (Butcher et al. 2018) . It"
"is a perfectly fine classification, absolutely clear as to what it is and what it 
is supposed to do. Then there is the act of classification i.e. deciding what 
interventions a nurse, or healthcare provider have done on a particular"
"occasion. As an example, the entry for activities relating to Hypertension 
includes 50 -100 activities. Here are a brief few of those:  
 
• Instruct at -risk patients to have regular preventative health 
screenings, including electrocardiogram, echocardiogram,"
"electrolytes, urinalysis, as indicated  
• Instruct related to healthy dietary pattern  
• Instruct related to proper physical activity (e.g., exercise 30 to 45 
minutes a day)  
• Instruct related to contributing lifestyle habits that should be"
"avoided (e.g., use of tobacco in any form and alcohol)"
"400 • Instruct the patient on lifestyle modification related to sleep and 
rest patterns (e.g., 8 hours per night is recommended)  
• Provide information on possible changes in lifestyle necessary to 
avoid future complications and control the disease process"
"• Provide information related to the purpose and benefit of the 
lifestyle changes  
• Instruct related to self -blood pressure monitoring and to report 
abnormal findings  
• Instruct the patient on possible causes of hypertension  
• Instruct the patient and family to take an active role in the"
"management of disease process, (e.g., medication indications and 
administration, maintaining proper diet, exercise and healthy 
habits, quitting smoking, reducing stress, reducing weight, 
reducing sodium intake, reducing alcohol consumption, 
increasing exercise, as indicated)"
"• Instruct the patient and family on medication usage and 
indications  
• Encourage the patient and family to maintain a list of current 
medications and reconcile routinely at wellness checks, hospital 
visits, or hospital admissions"
"• Instruct the patient to recognize and avoid situations that can 
cause increased BP (e.g., stress or sudden discontinuation of drug 
treatment)  
 (Butcher et al. 2018)  p.213 -214 
 
Suppose a nurse interacts with a hypertension patient and there is a serious"
"back -and-forth medical conversation. A question is: which of these 
activities has the nurse done? No doubt the nurse himself, and the local 
general medical environment know reasonably well. The point being made 
here is that the act of classification, deciding which items belong in which"
"classes, is fallible, and it is subject to mistakes and possible even to 
deliberate misuse or malfeasance."

Appendix  B: Working With LLMs  
 
B.1 Introduction  
 
Do yourself a favor. Learn as much as you can about LLMs. You can go a  
long way merely by getting access and by typing.  You can go further by 
having the computer programming language Python on your computer and"
"using an LLM development environment like LangChain.  
 
Many of the  major LLM  implementations are readily available. As 
examples:  
 
• Bard (using LaMDA) is available from https://bard.google.com . It is 
free.  Bard implementations will usually have  a microphone icon and"
"can take spoken, or dictated, input. [That will make interactions 
quicker.]  
• GPT -4 and ChatGPT are available from https://openai.com . Some 
modes of access are free. Others can paid for either by usage or by 
monthly subscription.  Current s ubscription to GPT -Plus is $20 a"
"month. With a subscription, t he page https://chat.openai.com/  
access to GPT -3.5 and GPT -4, and to plugins and web browsing 
enhancements. There are about 120 plugins available at the moment 
(with many more to come, no doubt). You are allowed to have 3"
"plugins enabled at one time. The author has Wolfram (which gives 
mathematics and more reliable facts and factual statistics), ScholarAI"
"403 (which helps with scientific papers), and Prompt Perfect. Separately 
the author has an API (Application Programming Interface) key to 
GPT APIs. This is for programs using a GPT LLM and is charged by 
the access (usually just cents for a day's work). More on the 
programming later."
"• ChatGPT is also available as a free app for the iPhone (and there will 
be a free app for Android phones).  
• Bing, a search engine (using GPT -4) is available on a web -browser, as 
an app for smartphones, as part of a chatbot voice assistant on"
"Amazon Echo, and Google Home . New Bing is available from 
https://www.bing.com/new  
 
We are going to use Application Programming Interfaces (API) for 
interacting with the LLMs. A valuable resource, with many links to 
materials is  
 
OpenAI Cookbook (OpenAI [2022] 2023)"
"B.2 Prompts and Prompt Engineering  
 
An LLM takes some text (or images, or sounds) as an input prompt and 
returns text (or images, or sounds) as its response. For our purposes, we 
will generally assume that prompts are given as text in English. Crafting a"
"prompt to obtain the right or desired kind of response is Prompt 
Engineering . Prompt engineering is an active research area, with  hundreds 
of publications. There are also many excellent educational sources for 
learning prompt engineering. One example is The Prompt Engineering"
"404 Guide  (Saravia 2023)  created by Elvis Saravia of Dair.ai (Democratizing 
Artificial Intelligence Research, Education, and Technologies) . That work is 
clear and comprehensive. We will sketch or paraphrase some of it to give"
"you, the reader, some idea of the strengths and weaknesses of prompt 
engineering.  
 
A point to be made is that you never really know what quite what you are 
going to get as the output from an LLM  using a prompt . For a start, the"
"relationship between the prompt and the response is probabilistic and 
usually exactly the same prompt can produce two or three different 
responses. ( If the LLM produces t hese  automatically, they  are sometimes 
called drafts.) Then there is the fact that the textual prompt s are given in"
"natural language, say English, and any natural language has a penumbra of 
uncertainty and ambiguity about meaning. In computer programming , the 
programs are usually written in a programming language, say Haskell , 
which has a formal definitive syntax and semantics.  There is no doubt"
"whether an expression in the language is well -formed and no doubt as to 
what i t means. In contrast, the LLMs are being prompted by textual strings 
which may or may not be correct English and which may or may not have 
an unambiguous meaning. Then the response, the output, is also in possibly"
"ambiguous English in an intended or unintended format. These 
considerations suggest that there is a trial -and-error, and experimental,

Explanation 	
[The prompt]"
"Explain prompting used in Large Language Models  
[GPT -3.5 replies ] 
Prompting is a technique used in large language models like GPT -
3 to generate desired responses or outputs. When using a 
language model, you typically provide it with a prompt, which is a"
"short piece of text that frames the context or question for the 
model. The model then generates a continuation of the prompt 
based on its training and the patterns it has learned from the data.  
Prompting serves multiple purposes:  
Context setting: The prompt helps establish the context for"
"the model, giving it an understanding of the desired topic or"
"406 domain. For example, if you want to generate a news article 
about a specific event, you can provide a prompt that 
summarizes the key details of the event.  
Instructional guidance: The prompt can include explicit 
instructions or guidelines for the model to follow. These"
"instructions help steer the model's response in a particular 
direction. For instance, if you want the model to write a 
poem about nature, you can include instructions like ""Write 
a poem about the beauty of nature and the changing 
seasons."""
"Question -answering: You can use prompts to ask specific 
questions to the model. By providing a question as a 
prompt, you can expect the model to generate an answer or 
response based on its understanding of the question and the 
knowledge it has acquired."
"Desired output control: By carefully designing the prompt, 
you can influence the style, tone, or structure of the 
generated text. For example, if you want the model to 
produce a response in a formal or casual tone, you can 
explicitly specify that in the prompt."
"It's important to note that the effectiveness of prompting can vary 
depending on the language model and the specific task at hand. 
Experimentation and iteration with different prompts are often 
required to achieve the desired results.

"stands for ""Generative Pre -trained Transformer 3"" and is one of 
the most well -known and widely used LLMs developed by 
OpenAI. It has been trained on a vast amount of text data and is

"What is a good way to learn how to use a LLM? Please keep your 
answer brief.  
[Bard , with the option to v iew other drafts ] 
Here are some good ways to learn how to use a LLM:  
• Read the documentation.  Most LLMs come with extensive"
"documentation that explains how to use them. This is a great 
place to start learning the basics of how to interact with the

• Take a tutorial.  There are many tutorials available online that 
can teach you how to use a LLM. These tutorials can be a great"
"way to learn the basics of how to use the model and how to 
apply it to different tasks.  
• Experiment.  The best way to learn how to use a LLM is to 
experiment with it. Try different prompts and see what kind of 
responses you get. You can also try using the model to 
complete different tasks."
"• Join a community.  There are many online communities where 
people discuss LLMs. These communities can be a great 
resource for learning new things about LLMs and getting help 
from other users.  
Here are some additional tips for learning how to use a LLM:"
"• Start with a simple task. When you're first starting out, it's best 
to start with a simple task. This will help you learn the basics of 
how to interact with the model without getting overwhelmed.  
• Be patient. LLMs can be slow, especially when they're first"
"being trained. Be patient and give the model time to generate a 
response."
"408 • Don't be afraid to ask for help. If you're stuck, don't be afraid to 
ask for help from other users or from the documentation.  
With a little practice, you'll be using LLMs like a pro in no time!  
 
Text	Classification 	
Is the following text friendly or confrontational? Text: Hey you get"
"offa my cloud  
[Bard]  
The text ""Hey you get offa my cloud"" is confrontational. It uses the 
words ""hey"" and ""get offa,"" which are both informal and 
aggressive. The sentence also contains a direct command, which 
can be seen as rude.  
Here are some ways to make the text more friendly:"
"• ""Excuse me, but could you please get off my cloud?""  
• ""I'm sorry, but I need to use my cloud. Could you please 
move?""  
• ""Would you mind getting off my cloud? I need to use it.""  
These sentences are all more polite and less confrontational than"
"the original text. They also use more formal language, which can 
make the request seem more reasonable.

"• It uses the built -in sum  function to add up the numbers, and 
the len function to find how many numbers there are.  
• It returns the sum divided by the count, which is the average.

write a parser to parse LISP expressions  
[GPT -4] 
Sure, here's a very basic recursive LISP parser written in Python. 
This parser will be able to handle simple LISP expressions like"
"(add 1 2)  or (mul (add 1 2) (add 3 4)) . Please note that this is 
a basic implementation and does not cover all aspects of LISP. It's 
a simplified version to give you a head start.  
 
def parse_lisp(expression):  
    def tokenize(expression):  
        return expression.replace('(', ' ("
"').replace(')', ' ) ').split()  
         
    def read_from_tokens(tokens):  
        if len(tokens) == 0:  
            raise SyntaxError('unexpected EOF')  
             
        token = tokens.pop(0)  
        if token == '(':  
            L = [] 
            while tokens[0] != ')':"
L.append(read_from_tokens(tokens))
"410             tokens.pop(0) # pop off ')'  
            return L

            raise SyntaxError('unexpected )')  
        else: 
            try: return int(token)

This code takes a LISP expression as input, tokenizes it (splits it"
"into separate parts), and then recursively parses the tokens into 
nested lists. Symbols are kept as strings, and numbers are 
converted to integers or floats.  
Remember that this parser won't actually evaluate  the LISP 
expressions —it just parses them. If you want to evaluate them as"
"well, you'll need to implement an evaluator that understands the 
different LISP functions (like add , mul , etc.).

trivial either . The answer is pretty impressive . */ 
Reasoning"
"The detective reasoned. If there is blood on the knife, the butler 
committed the crime. There is no blood on the knife. Therefore 
the butler did not commit the crime. Is this valid reasoning?  
[GPT -4] 
The reasoning here seems to follow the format of Modus Tollens,"
"which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. However, the"
"411 initial conditional (""If there is blood on the knife, the butler 
committed the crime."") may not be necessarily true in all cases.  
Modus Tollens reasoning goes like this:  
1. If P, then Q.  
2. Not Q.  
3. Therefore, not P.  
In this case:"
"1. If there is blood on the knife (P), then the butler committed 
the crime (Q).  
2. There is no blood on the knife (Not P).  
3. Therefore, the butler did not commit the crime (Not Q).  
While it is valid reasoning according to Modus Tollens, it is"
"contingent on the truth of the initial conditional statement. In this 
case, the conditional statement seems to suggest that only the 
butler could have left blood on the knife, which is quite an 
assumption. The blood could have come from someone else or the"
"butler might have cleaned the knife, for instance. Therefore, while 
the logic is structurally sound, the premises (the assumptions or 
facts that the argument is based on) may not be valid, and thus the 
conclusion could potentially be flawed."
"/*Note from MF. GPT -4's answer here basically is completely 
wrong.  It pulls up Modus Tollens, which is fine. But then it muddles up its 
Ps and Qs. Look at the lines numbered 2. The Modus Tollens schema 
requires Not Q but then it uses Not P as an instance of that."
"GPT -4 is attempting reasoning, but does not succeed in this case.  */ 
B.2.2 Examples of Few -Shot Prompting  
Few -shot prompting covers cases where examples are given. Outside of 
LLMs it is very common when giving instructions to give at least one"
"example of what is required (say, when teaching mathematics or passive 
voice construction in English writing). Most LLMs can work just from 
examples — they do not need the instruction or explanation ."
"412  
Here is an example of o ne-shot. The LLM has been given a single example 
of an English to French translation and, without even being told what the 
task is, it has figured out what to do and has done it.  
 
sea otter => loutre de mer  
peppermint =>  
[GPT -4]"
"[GPT -4] 
The translation for ""peppermint"" in French is ""menthe poivrée"".  
 
[While this is an example of one -shot prompting, it is unclear how good it is 
as a test of the LLM. It is from (Brown et al. 2020, 7) . That is the main 
research paper on few -shot prompting. The LLM may have seen it"
"thousands of times during training.]  
 
Here is an example of many -shot.  
 
cat=>cats  
rabbit=>rabbits  
mouse=>  
[GPT -4] 
The plural form of ""mouse"" is ""mice"".  
 
You can see here how problems might arise. The LLM needs to spot the"
"pattern. The two examples can be construed either as forming the plural 
form or as adding the letter 's' on the end of a word or noun.  
 
cat=>cats  
rabbit=>rabbits  
mouse=>mouses  
man=>mans  
woman=>"
"413 [GPT -4] 
The plural of ""woman"" is ""women"".  
 
Then  
 
ctt=>ctts  
bbit=>bbits  
xouse=>xouses  
mnn=>mnns  
woman=>  
[GPT -4] 
Following the same pattern you've established with the other 
words, the transformation of ""woman"" would be ""womans""."
"However, it's important to note that in standard English, the 
plural of ""woman"" is ""women"".  
 
It is just too clever!  
 
B.2.3 Chain of Thought Prompting  
Jeff Dean writes  
One of the broad key challenges in arti ficial intelligence is to build"
"systems that can perform multi -step reasoning, learning to break 
down complex problems into smaller tasks and combining 
solutions to those to address the larger problem. (Dean 2023)  
 
When ChatGPT came out, say November 2022, it was clear the available"
"LLMs  were weak in this area. Plainly, they could not do mathematical, 
logical, and scientific reasoning. It was found that to a degree this could be 
ameliorated by asking the LLM to show its reasoning, to show the steps it 
made — i.e. to show its chain of thought (Wei and Zhou 2022; Wei et al."
2023) . One of the examples that Jason Wei and Denny Zhou give is this
"414  
Figure 28. Standard Prompting and Chain -of-Thought 
Prompting  (Wei and Zhou 2022) . 
 
There is a one -shot prompt here, showing an example and the example 
displays the reasoning. It soon became clear that this could be done zero -"
"shot, without examples, merely by adding to the original prompt:  
 
Let's think step by step.  
 
Then this adjustment of the prompt could be done automatically  (for 
example, by the use of templates, which we will get to). This is an ongoing"
"area of experimentation and discovery. Getting the LLM to think step by 
step, and to show its reasoning, is a good idea."
"415 B.2.4 Tuning, or Configuring, the Models or Prompts  
 
Most LLMs have a parameter — 'temperature' — that can be set prior to 
prompting. The background explanation of this is that an LLM's response 
involves a choice among probabilities. For example, with cloze task like"
"London is the capital city of [mask]  
 
there will be several possibilities for the blank e.g. 'England', 'culture', 
'fashion', 'progress', etc. and these will have different probabilities. Now, if 
the LLM always choses the most probable response to a word, phrase,"
"sentence, etc., it will always give the same answer. You might not want this. 
For example, if, on different romantic occasions,  like date night once a 
week,  you asked for a love poem for your sweetheart, you presumably 
would not want the same poem each time. On the other hand, if the LLM"
"always choses improbable answers, the answers may be interesting and 
humorous, but also often plain wrong. So, there is a parameter 
'temperature' which adjusts for this. A higher temperature means that the 
LLM  is more likely to generate creative and interesting answers, while a"
"lower temperature means that LLM  is more likely to generate factual and 
accurate answers.  Temperature is in the range 0 -1 and it would ordinary be 
set by default to 0.7. In the case of Bard, it can be set using the following 
syntax : 
 
bard.generate(prompt, temperature=0.5)"
For example :
"416  
bard.generate( ""London is the capital city of …"" , temperature=0)  
 
The syntax for setting the temperature in other LLMs may well be different.  
 
We know that typically the large models can make mistakes. They are not"
"100% reliable. GPT -4V is no different in this regard. We also know that the 
models can give two contradictory answers to the same prompt in the same 
context. That such answers are contradictory means that one of these"
"answers is false.  That is, more generally, the models can give false answers. 
Also, in more than a few cases there can be no practical means for the user 
to check the answer. For example:  
 
 
 
Figure 29. GPT -4V on Prime Numbers."
"This answer may be right, or it may be wrong. Typical users would have no 
idea how to check which it is, or whether they should repose trust in what 
GPT -4V is telling them."
"417 There are ways to improve the quality of answers. There are two standard 
techniques: imposing constraints and giving the LMM (or LLM) a 
reputation.  
 
Constraint prompting  is requiring the LMM to answer in a restricted"
"(‘constrained’) way or format. For example, one constrained prompt to read 
a driving license would be:  
 
 
 
Figure 30. Screenshot of GPT -4V Reading a Driving License  from 
(Yang et al. 2023) . 
 
This is better than just prompting the LMM to ‘read the text in the image."
"[Notice that it has made a mistake with the HAIR.]  
 
As explained in Sections 3.10 and 4.7, Base Models of LMMs are trying only 
to produce the next word as output. They need further training to become 
Instructor Tuned, or Fine Tuned, LLMs. But even at this point, they are"
"418 only doing an extension of their training. Many kinds of instruction or 
prompting can invoke an activity without necessarily emphasizing that the 
outcome be correct or true. Yang et al. mention in their paper the prompt"
"‘Count the number of apples in the image’, where the image is of apples laid 
out in rows and columns (Yang et al. 2023) . Now, depending on its training, 
an LMM can count without really focusing on producing a correct answer. 
A better style of prompt conditions on good performance . An example"
"prompt for the apple image would be ‘You are an expert in counting things 
in images. Let us count the number of apples in this image by <and then 
give detailed instructions on how to do it, and how to check the answer.>’ 
Some of the recent LLMs accept both ‘System Prompts’ and (Other)"
"‘Prompts’.  A system prompt could then be used to set the system as being 
in the context where it was an expert in counting objects in images. This use 
of system prompts is often used to enhance ‘steerability’. If you would like"
"to ‘steer’ an LLM to be an be an expert in counting or to answer in the style 
of Emily Dickinson, you would use a system prompt to do it.  
 
 
B.3 Choices on  Development  
 
Most ML programming work will either use Python or allow Python to be"
"used. In turn Python is generally available on Macs, Windows, and Linux 
machines. Python will use 'pip' which is a package installer. Pip will usually 
be installed automatically with Python.  
 
To check whether you have what is needed use a terminal and try the 
following 3 commands:"
"419  
% python3 --version 
Python 3.11.3  
 
% where python3  
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin/pyth
on3 
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/bin/pytho
n3 
/usr/local/bin/python3  
/usr/bin/python3  
% pip --version 
pip 23.1.2 from"
"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/pyth
on3.11/site -packages/pip (python 3.11)  
 
The response to you on your machine should be somewhat similar, 
although probably not exactly the same. If you seem not to have Python, go 
to https://www.python.org/  and install it."
"To give you a general idea where we are going here. We are not going to 
create any LLMs (which would take months and might cost tens  of millions 
of dollars). We are going to work with existing LLMs (e.g. GPT -4) using 
their APIs. We will send some messages and get replies, both of which we"
"can process as we would like. There will be short Python programs — 
usually around  50 lines — to do the work. Typically , these Python programs 
will have 'import ' statements at the top, for example : 
 
import langchain  
from langchain.llms import OpenAI"
"420 from langchain.utilities import WikipediaAPIWrapper  
 
### langchain this is a convenient host system for working 
with LLMs  
### OpenAI gives us the API to GPT -3 GPT-4 etc.  
### WikipediaAPIWrapper  allows us to ask for material from 
Wikipedia"
"Of course, starting out you will not have  the OpenAI (and other) packages 
on your computer. This is where the Python package installer pip comes 
into play. There will be commands like : 
 
% pip install -r requirements.txt  
 
% pip install langchain"
"where, the requirements file has a list of, surprise, the requirements. You 
do not need to worry about this right now.  
 
As to Foundation Models,  the LLMs,  they can be proprietary or open -
sourced. Proprietary are closed -source models, usually vastly expensive to"
"make and are owned by commercial companies. That they are 'closed -
source' means that the source computer code is not available to you. You 
cannot see it, you do not know what it is. This does and does not matter. It 
does not matter in that there is no possibility of you altering the code and"
"re-pre-training the model, because that might cost $10 million which you 
do n ot have to spare. It does matter in that whoever owns the code might 
change it or withdraw it (they might have a huff, stop playing the game, and"
"take their ball and go home). It also matters in that closed -source may be 
preferable  in that it presumably keeps powerful code out of the hands of"
"421 bad actors. It may be possible to get some kind of closed -source version of a 
Foundation Model, which has locked in parameters. That might protect you 
from malfeasance, or monopolistic behavior, by the Model's owner. If LLMs"
"develop as it seems they are going to, the models will have a role somewhat 
similar to public utilities. We need to be cautious when letting private 
companies have control of public utilities. Some Foundation Models have"
"been open sourced, and are freely available to all (to use, see, or develop). 
Hugging Face provides a hub, a library of open -source Foundation Models 
(Hugging Face 2023) . When you work with the APIs of OpenAI (or with 
HuggingFace, or with Pinecone…) you will need to get an API 'key'. Getting"
"these may vary a little from host to host. In the case of OpenAI, go to their 
website https://openai.com/  , create an account, then View API keys under 
your profile, and proceed from there. There are charges. Typically, they will"
"give you a $5 credit. The charges are reasonable. There is variation here 
but, ball -park figures, you can use their API all day for less than a dollar.  
 
Educators working with Python might use either or both of Jupyter  
notebooks or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). We should"
"probably follow along with both here.  
 
B.4 Moving Forward With LangChain  
 
B.4.0 A Note on the Status of LangChain and Similar as of 
11/6/2023"
"422 As mentioned earlier, on 11/6/2023, OpenAI released its builder framework 
for GPTs and these are assistants, some close to being agents, based on GPT 
software. Also, many of the techniques that third -party developers had"
"produced in the previous six months to enhance the original ChatGPT (such 
as being able to process private libraries, say of pdfs) have been rolled in to 
GPT -4 Turbo. This means that developers, and possibly even some start -up 
companies, are on shaky ground. OpenAI may have and release better"
"software, or they may simply absorb or mimic any outside software that 
appears.  
 
In the case of LangChain, it can work with LLMs from many different 
companies (e.g. from Google, from Meta, etc. — in fact with most of the 
open -source components from Hugging Face). There is a pedagogic"
"advantage to this — there is no lock -in to the one company (no matter how 
benevolent that company might be) . 
 
The whole AI-LLM landscape  is changing rapidly, and no one know exactly 
what is best. Our view is: doing some work with LangChain is good for"
"learning, but it might be prudent not to form your start -up around 
LangChain and seek venture capital funding on that basis.  
 
B.4.1 What is LangChain?  
LangChain is a software development framework designed to 
simplify the creation of applications using large language models"
"(LLMs). As a language model integration framework, LangChain's 
use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in 
general, including document analysis and summarization, 
chatbots, and code analysis . (Wikipedia 2023g)"
"423  
LangChain was created by Harrison Chase in October 2022 as an open -
source project  (Chase [2022] 2022) . As of May 2023, 836 developers had 
contributed to it. What it does is:  
 
1. Allows access to LLMs such as closed -source ones from OpenAI (e.g."
"GPT -4) or open -source ones from Hugging Face (e.g.  LLaMA	by	Meta	
AI	or	Flan -T5	by	Google ). 
2. Allows access to software to extract and manipulate text from 
resources such as pdfs (e.g. a User's research papers , a library's 
holdings ) or other sources (e.g. Wikipedia)"
"3. Allows access to software that creates embeddings . 
4. Allows access to vector databases to store, augment, or retrieve 
embeddings (such as Pinecone in the cloud) or (FAISS (Facebook AI 
Similarity Search)  on a local machines) ."
"5. Allows the combination of all these into 'chains' which can carry out 
any or all of the standard NLP , and other,  operations ( as a really 
simple example:  Find the population density of the capital of Great 
Britain [This might involve determining the capital of Great Britain;"
"then, having found that, determining its population, determining its 
area, and dividing one figure by the other]. ) 
6. Allows the combination of chains into 'agents', intelligent assistants 
which can carry their operations autonomously."
"LangChain  can be used to build applications such as chatbots, question 
answering systems, summarization systems, and computer code writing 
applications.  LangChain looks very promising.  LangChain has a website"
"424 https://langchain.com/ , and a conceptual guide 
https://docs.langchain.com/docs/  You should scan the conceptual guide.  
 
Prompt templates (once you get it right stick with it)  
 
Most of Meta/Facebook LLMs are open sourced.  
 
B.4.2 LangChain Experiments Displayed to  a Web Page"
"There are many excellent Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for 
Python. Two of them are: PyCharm from JetBrains

Of course, the LLM in general will likely give a different response every"
"time it is asked. Here is an alternative that it offered:  
 
The librarian, with her quiet grace, is the keeper of the written 
word. She moves among the stacks, a gentle guardian of 
knowledge. With each book she takes down, a new world unfolds"
"before her eyes. She is a seeker of truth, a lover of language, and a 
protector of ideas. Her hands are calloused from years of handling 
pages, but her spirit remains unbroken. She is the keeper of"
"430 secrets, the purveyor of dreams, and the champion of learning. 
The librarian is a treasure, a rare gem of wisdom and wonder.  
 
Document	 Embeddings 	
 
LLMs will be trained possibly on a large portion of  the public facing"
"Internet. But there are occasions when you might want to supplement this. 
As examples, an academic might want  regularly  to access and query all her 
own research publications and lectures,  a library might have a special 
collection of materials in need of LLM  processing."
"If the new content is brief — say a single newspaper article — it could be 
prepended to the prompt. But the prompts can only be short, say a few 
thousand 'tokens', so this idea is clunky and is not going to work in general. 
What is needed is for all the new documents to be processed into"
"embeddings (i.e. lists of numbers) and those lists to be stored in a vector 
database. The LLM will then augment its background by using the 
database.  
 
Python and LangChain have a number of tools to get the documents in the"
"right form in the first place  (e.g. Python Beautiful Soup can scrape web 
pages, Python PyPDF library can extract texts from pdfs).  
 
Just as a brief example here. Chapter 1 of this text has been printed as a pdf

Points  
 
There is a  conventional symbolization that will help here with probabilities. 
We will write p(A) to mean the probability of A where A is some sentence, 
for example, p(it is raining). Then there is the notion of conditional"
"probability  written p(A|B), where A and B are both sentences, and this is 
read 'the probability of A given B' or 'the probability of A given the 
condition B', for example p(Jane gets wet|it is raining) which would be read 
'the probability of Jane getting wet given than it is raining'."
"C.1 False Positives and False Negatives  
 
In medical testing, and more generally in binary classification, a 
false positive is an error in data reporting in which a test result 
improperly indicates presence of a condition, such as a disease"
"(the result is positive), when in reality it is not, while a false 
negative is an error in which a test result improperly indicates no 
presence of a condition (the result is negative), when in reality it is 
present.  (Wikipedia 2022d)"
"Aesop’s fable of the Shepherd Boy who cried ‘Wolf’ provides a classical 
partial illustration of this. We can modify the fable to become a full 
example. In Aesop, the boy is supposed to cry ‘Wolf’ when there is a wolf."
"So, the condition is the presence of a wolf, and the positive test for this is 
the boy’s cry of ‘Wolf’. Now, as we all know, in the fable, the boy become 
bored and lonely, and started crying ‘Wolf’ even though there was no wolf."
"These cries are all false positives  (the test is positive but the  condition 
does not exist). The villagers responded to these false positives, several"
"442 times over, rushing to be with the boy and to protect their flock. Later, a 
wolf actually did appear, and the boy cried ‘Wolf’. This cry is a true 
positive  (the test is positive and the condition does exist). However, the"
"villagers did not respond i.e. they ignored a true positive (largely because 
they were tired of false positives and mistook a true one for a false one). 
Here is our modification. All of us, the villagers and ourselves, know that"
"not being told that there is a wolf present is not the same as being told that 
there is not a wolf present. So, the villagers, desirous of peace of mind, set 
up the situation differently going forward. Apparently, the wolves in that"
"region were crepuscular. That means that they hunt at dawn and a dusk. 
They gave the Shepherd Boy a second task: he also had the job of crying ‘No 
wolf’ once at dawn and at dusk, on the condition that there was indeed no"
"wolf. Initially, the Shepherd Boy was conscientious with the second task. He 
made the appropriate cries in the absence of wolves. These cries are all 
true negatives . They are supposed to indicate the absence of a condition"
"and they do exactly that. But, we know, the boy was a bit of a larrikin. Sure 
enough, one dusk, a wolf appeared, and yet the boy cried ‘No wolf’. This cry 
would be a false negative  (the test is negative, but yet the condition does 
exist)."
"During a 24 hour period, the villagers might a) hear nothing (in which case, 
there would have been a failure in duties),  b) hear cries of ‘Wolf’ or ‘No 
Wolf’ at different times, dawn or dusk (these individually could be true or"
"false positives, or true or false negatives), or c) hear cries of ‘Wolf’ or ‘No 
Wolf’ at the same time (in which case, they would know that either the 
‘Wolf’ cry was a false positive or the ‘No Wolf’ cry was a false negative)."
"443 The various relations here between condition and test result can be 
expressed as conditional probabilities. We will relax our terminological 
conventions a little and just write ‘WolfCry’ and ‘NoWolfCry’ for the cries 
and ‘WolfPresent’ and ‘NoWolfPresent’ for the conditions. Then the"
"probabilities are  
 
p(WolfCry |WolfPresent )  True positive  
p(WolfCry |NoWolfPresent )  False positive  
p(NoWolfCry |NoWolfPresent ) True negative  
p(NoWolfCry |WolfPresent )  False negative  
 
The general theory here finds its greatest application perhaps in medicine."
"We all know of false positives, negatives, and the like, in the context of 
Covid tests. Almost all real world tests do have false positives, false 
negatives, etc. Typical values for these probabilities might be around 0.05"
"(roughly, 1 in 20 results is a false positive or false negative). Were the 
probabilities to be much higher than this, the tests would be regarded as 
being unsatisfactory.  
 
As we will see shortly , the fact that a test seems to 'indicate' that a person"
"does or does not have a disease with a certain probability does not 
actually means that the probability in question is indeed the probability of 
the person actually having the disease. There is another factor.  
 
C.2 The Base -Rate Fallacy"
"The Base -Rate Fallacy, sometimes known under the heading ‘Harvard 
Medical School Test’, is probably the most common case of probabilistic"
"444 reasoning where in real life almost everyone is tempted to reason 
incorrectly.  
 
Say there is some dread disease — Lurgi — and there is a test for the disease. 
This test is very good. So good, in fact, that if anyone actually has the Lurgi"
"then  there is a  0.95 probability  that the test will show positive (and a 0.05 
probability , when the person actually has the Lurgi , that the test will say 
that they do not have it — the 'false negatives') i .e. 
 
p (PositiveTest  | Lurgi)  = 0.95 or 95%"
"p (NegativeTest | Lurgi) = 0.05 or 5%  
 
Now assume we test  John Smith, and sad to say, the test is positive.  So, 
does John Smith have the Lurgi ? Is it probable that he has the Lurgi ? Do we 
know anything at all about whether John Smith has the Lurgi  (on the basis"
"of this test and its result alone)?  
 
We know two pieces of information  
 
p (PositiveTest | Lurgi)  = 0.95 or 95%  
John Smith has tested  positive.  
 
and we are trying to find out John Smith's status viz -a-viz Lurgi . 
What we would like to know, or need to know, first off, is this"
"p (Lurgi |  PositiveTest)  = ? 
 
but there is no way of reasoning from"
"445 p (PositiveTest | Lurgi)  
 
alone, to   
 
p (Lurgi |  PositiveTest)  
 
One aspect of the difficulty is that we do not know the rate for the false 
positives.  (Another is that we do not know the background rate, or base"
"rate, for Lurgi . We will get to that shortly). Conclusion: w e know nothing 
about  John Smith's status viz -a-viz Lurgi . 
 
Now, let us allow us to have information on the false positives. Say  
 
p(PositiveTest|~Lurgi)=0.1"
"We now know a) the probabilities for the true positives (o.95) and for the 
false positives (0.1) and b) that John Smith has tested positive. Do we know 
whether it is probable that John Smith has Lurgi . What we are being"
"tempted with here is what is known as the base -rate fallacy  (Amos Tversky 
and Kahneman 1982) . 
 
Many of the misleading (or trick) examples  of this  are set up in the same 
way. There is a very low background probability of something, say of a"
"person having Lurgi , which we will set for this example as being 0.01. And 
there is some sort of test for the condition of having Lurgi , which is pretty 
good, say p(PositiveTest| Lurgi ) = 0.9 5. But the test also gives some false"
"positives (that is to say, it occasionally indicates that a person has Lurgi  
when they do not have it), say p(PositiveTest |~Lurgi )=0.1.  Th en we are"
"446 told the following story and asked the following question. A person goes in 
and is tested for Lurgi  and the test is positive, is the probable that the 
person has Lurgi ? Most of us say that it is, whereas, in fact, it is very"
"unlikely. A good way to see this (and how Bayes’  Theorem  applies) is to re -
tell the story in terms of “natural” frequencies. In this story, y ou live in a 
town of 10000 people and 100 of them have Lurgi . Everybody is tested for"
"Lurgi . Of those hundred people with Lurgi , 95 test positive. Of those 9,900 
without Lurgi , 990 test positive for Lurgi  (the false positives).  You test 
positive for Lurgi . Is it likely that you have Lurgi ? Well, you have a 9 5/990"
"i.e. about a 1 in 11 chance of having it, and about a 10 in 11 chance of not 
having it. You probably do not have it. The correct reasoning here is an 
instance of Bayes’  Theorem, in the form  
 
p(Lurgi |PositiveTest ) =  
 
   p(positive | Lurgi ) x p(Lurgi )"
"p(positive| Lurgi )p(Lurgi )+p(positive|~ Lurgi)p(~ Lurgi ) 
 
 
With numbers  
 
p(Lurgi |PositiveTest ) =   .95 x .01   
        .95x.01+.1x.99  
=> 
 
p(Lurgi |PositiveTest ) =    .0095    
        .009 5 +.099  
 
What we are tempted to do when reasoning badly is a) to focus on how"
"good the test is when giving positive results from positive cases, and b) 
ignoring the background rate (how rare the disease is, simpliciter ). And"
"447 what we need to do is a) take the false positives into account, check how 
often the test gives a positive result from a negative case,  and b) remember 
the background rate (then, roughly: if the disease is rare, and the test can"
"give false positives, the probability is that a positive is a false positive).  
 
Consider this. We have a test that is pretty good in that it usually comes out 
positive for those that have the disease, but it does produce some false"
"positives, perhaps 5%.  This means that if you test 100 people, who do not 
have the disease, 5 of them might test positive. It also means that  if you test 
100 million people, who do not have the disease, 5 million of them might"
"test positive. That is quite a lot!  So, if you screened the entire population of 
the US (say 300 million) you might have 15 million false positives.  Now if 
the disease is very rare in the population (for example, folk in the US having"
"Ebola, which might be 1,2, or 3 people only).  If you test someone for in the 
US for Ebola (with one of those 5% false positive tests above), and they test 
positive, it is much more likely that they are a false positive (and they don't"
"have Ebola) than it is that they have Ebola.  Thinking otherwise is the so -
called base rate fallacy.  
 
[Experts will know that, strictly speaking, parts of the ‘natural frequencies’ 
explanation are not entirely correct in full detail. We will not worry about 
that here. ]"

It may be wise to say a word or two about causality. Philosophers have 
studied causality for thousands of years. They have made progress, but 
their theories are way too complex for us. The computer scientist Judea"
"Pearl introduced a way of thinking about causality that was suitable for 
reasoning about causality in the setting of artificial intelligence and 
machine learning (Pearl 2009b) . What was needed here is some principled 
way of understanding correlation and causation and their differences. Here"
"is a proposal following from the wider work of Pearl and his intellectual 
colleagues. In statements like:  
 
Taking aspirins causes relief from headaches.  
 
there are t hree  features of interest. There is a direction, a direction in time."
"The earlier taking of aspirins produces, brings about, or ‘causes’ the later 
relief from headaches. The later relief from headaches does not produce, 
bring about or ‘cause’ the earlier taking of aspirins. Second, there is an"
"association or correlation between the cause and the effect. In the example 
case, there is a regularity between taking aspirins and relief from 
headaches. This regularity is not an absolute guarantee.  For o ne reason or 
another, the taking of aspirins does not always relieve headaches on all"
"occasions. However, the taking of aspirins does increase the chance, or 
likelihood, or probability, that the headaches will be relieved. Thirdly, there 
is what might be called an intervention or counterfactual factor. Often with"
"450 causality, we have the ability to intervene or produce or change or 
manipulate the cause  in an attempt to manipulate the effect . This is a great 
and desirable feature. Were our teenage child to have a headache, we could"
"give them an aspirin and this may well provide relief.  Similarly , here we can 
reason counterfactually. If the child in fact had not been given an aspirin, 
we might make the  consoling observation ‘you know, an aspirin would have"
"helped you’. Plain correlation, without causation, does not have a direction, 
does , or can, involve probabilities,  does not give us the ability to 
manipulate outcomes , and does not support counterfactuals . Cirrhosis of"
"the liver is caused by drinking alcohol. Smoking is correlated with cirrhosis 
of the liver  (among the population to date ). Current s mokers and non -
smokers have different probabilities of having cirrhosis of the liver. Those"
"with cirrhosis of the liver and those without cirrhosis of the liver have 
different probabilities of being smokers. But  an intervention that stops you 
smoking, if you are a smoker, does not change your probability of getting"
"cirrhosis of the liver (provided all other factors are unchanged, in particular 
whether you drink or not).  Smoking is correlated with cirrhosis of the liver, 
but it does not cause cirrhosis of the liver.  
 
In sum , with causality, there is a direction , changing  of probability , and the"
"possibility of interventions and counterfactuals . 
 
There can be causal talk, correlation talk, and ‘weaselly’ talk (which is talk 
intending to make the reader think of causality.) Nick Huntington -Klein  
gives useful examples of the words and phrases in use here:"
What are some of these words?
"451  
We can say that X causes Y by saying: X causes  Y, X affects Y, the 
effect of X on Y, X increases/decreases Y, X changes Y, X leads  to 
Y, X determines  Y, X triggers  Y, X improves Y, X is responsible for 
Y, and so on..."
"We can say that X and Y are related without implying causality by 
saying X and Y: are  associated, are correlated, are related, tend to 
occur together, tend not to occur together, go together, and so 
on...  
 
If some weaselly writer  … doesnʼt want to say causality but does"
"want the reader to hear  it, they might say: X is linked to Y, X is 
followed by Y, X has ramifications for Y, X predicts  Y , people who 
X are more likely to  Y , Y happens as X happens, and many others.  
 
Knowing these terms can help you interpret what scientific studies"
"are really saying, and when someone might be trying to pull one 
over on you  (Huntington -Klein 2022) . 
 
D.2 Causal Diagrams  
 
Researchers in ML, and, indeed, in causality and statistics in general, often 
employ causal diagrams (Pearl 2009a; Scheines 1997; Pearl 1995) . These"
"are useful in many settings, in particular with being assured that 
predictions have genuine substance, and with addressing questions of bias 
and fairness. When we can identify causes in a system, two possibilities 
open up. If we can also manipulate or adjust or change the causes, we may"
"be able to change the effects (and this may be very desirable). Separately, 
we can start reasoning counterfactually. That is, thinking what would, or 
might happen, were the causes to be changed (and this counterfactual 
analysis may give us insight on bias and fairness, among other things)."
"452   
Causal diagrams use variables and arrows. For example, if we think, as a 
causal model, that smoking causes lung cancer, the following diagram 
might be suitable : 
 
 
Figure 40. A Causal Diagram Showing Smoking Causing Lung 
Cancer ."
"The arrow indicates our views on causality (in this case, that smoking 
causes lung cancer — that smoking is a direct  cause of lung cancer). The 
arrow is an arrow of causality. The causality flows 'downstream' from the 
smoking to the lung cancer. Sometimes the direct cause, or tail of the"
"arrow, is called the 'parent', then the adjacent variable that the head of the 
arrow attaches to would be the 'child'.  
 
Such diagrams have two roles. As far as causality is concerned, there is no 
data involved. We have produced this model out of thin air, or out of our"
"ideas, theories, conjectures, or background knowledge. The causality here is 
not deterministic. It does not mean that every single smoker gets lung 
cancer as a piece of inexorable mechanistic clockwork. Rather, it is about"
"the category or type or class of smokers — that at least some of them are 
caused to get lung cancer by their smoking (other things being equ al). If 
this diagram is correct, the second role will come into play, and that is that"
"there will be a statistical connection, or correlation, or dependence, or 
association, between smoking and lung cancer. Data is involved here. We"
"453 would expect to see a correlation between the folk who smoke and the folk 
who get lung cancer. The diagram says nothing at all about what it is to be a 
smoker — whether the values here are just 'Yes' or 'No' or whether there are"
"grades or degrees of being a smoker. Similarly, it says nothing at all about 
the values for the variable lung cancer. Also, the diagram says nothing 
about what the causal effect is. We know full well that being a smoker"
"increases  the probability of getting lung cancer. But as far as the semantics 
of the diagram is concerned, the arrow just asserts that there is some causal 
effect, or causal association between the two variables. Smoking may"
"increase lung cancer, it may decrease lung cancer, the arrow in the diagram 
is agnostic on this.  
 
Arrows show causal connection. Lack of arrows show (presumed) absence 
of causal connection. We have only two variables in our diagram. More"
"complex diagrams may have many more variables. We have to be explicit 
with our commitments — put arrows between variables if our model 
assumes a causal connection, omit arrows where we assume no connection. 
Obviously, for example, in our simple case, something may cause smoking,"
"and lung cancer itself may cause other effects. But a causal diagram does 
not need to contain the world history, or the world future. There just needs 
to be enough variables for the problem at hand.  
 
There is a requirement or constraint on the variables and arrows. If any two"
"variables have a common cause — that is, another variable that causes both 
of them — that variable, that common cause, and its arrows, need to be in 
the diagram. [This requirement is known as the Causal Markov Condition .] 
We have only two variables in our diagram, so only two to check (i.e."
"454 smoking and lung cancer). But suppose we theorize that there is a gene that 
causes smoking and, also, that gene causes lung cancer (the gene does, by 
itself). Then, to be a causal diagram — to satisfy the Causal Markov 
Condition — our diagram would need to be modified to :"
"Figure 41. Smoking Causing Lung Cancer And a Gene Causing 
Both of These Conditions . 
 
[In fact, we are not here going to assume that there is such a gene, so the 
original diagram, with just two variables is a causal diagram as it stands. It 
satisfies the Causal Markov Condition.]"
"There are three components, or building blocks, or modules, that might 
occur in a causal diagram: chains , forks , and collisions . 
 
To introduce chains, we need paths  and paths are sequences of adjacent 
arrows. If the arrows in a path connect head -to-tail, the path is a directed"
"path, otherwise the path is an undirected  path. A chain , or causal chain , is 
a directed path between variables. In the diagram :"
"455  
Figure 42. A Causal Chain From Smoking to Lung Cancer . 
 
There is just the one chain: Smoking ->Lung Cancer . More detail can be 
added between the variables for smoking and the lung cancer. For example, 
there might be cell mutation and it may be valuable to include an"
"(intermediary) variable for that. A more complete diagram might be :  
 
 
Figure 43. A Causal Chain From Smoking to Lung Cancer 
Mediated by Cell Mutation . 
 
In this diagram there are three (causal) chains: Smoking ->Cell 
Mutation, Cell Mutation ->Lung Cancer , Smoking ->Cell"
"Mutation ->Lung Cancer . Interest will likely be with causal chain 
between smoking and cancer, and if indeed smoking causes cancer there 
will be correlation between the two. There also will be a correlation between 
smoking and cell mutation and cell mutation and lung cancer."
"A fork  is where there is a common cause of two variables. If we think, as a 
causal model, that smoking causes both lung cancer and yellow stains on a 
smoker's fingers, the following diagram might be suitable :"
"456  
Figure 44. A Fork from Smoking to Yellow Fingers and Lung 
Cancer . 
 
In this, smoking is a common cause of both yellow fingers and lung cancer. 
This, a common cause, is a fork . Forks need care where correlations are"
"concerned. Smoking will be correlated with yellow fingers, smoking will be 
correlated with lung cancer, and yellow fingers will be correlated with lung 
cancer . There is a little more that can be said. There is the notion of"
"conditioning  and a simple explanation of conditioning is that it is knowing 
or fixing the value of a variable. Suppose the smoking variable c an have two 
values only: being a smoker, or not being a smoker. Consider just non -"
"smokers. Some of them will have yellow fingers. Few or none of them will 
have lung cancer. But now there will be no correlation between the yellow 
fingers and lung cancer. It is the smoking that causes lung cancer, but none"
"of the people in the group are smokers. Equally, consider just smokers. 
Some of them will have yellow fingers. Some of them will have lung cancer. 
Again, there will be no correlation between the yellow fing ers and lung"
"cancer. It is the smoking that causes lung cancer, but all of the people in the 
group are smokers. So, if we conditionalize on the smoking variable, there 
is no correlation between yellow fingers and lung cancer. In sum here,"
"where there is a common cause, a fork, there is correlation (or dependence)"
"457 between the effects. But if the analysis conditions on the common cause 
there is no conditional correlation (or conditional dependence) between the 
effects.   
 
A collision  is when there is a common effect of two different causes."
"Smoking is not the only action that causes lung cancer. Exposure to 
asbestos can cause lung cancer. We might not be especially interested in the 
asbestos cause. But if we are, we might produce a diagram similar to this : 
 
 
 
Figure 45. A Fork from Smoking and Asbestos to Lung Cancer ."
"Consider the path Smoking -> Lung Cancer < - Asbestos . This is an 
undirected path, and the path enters and leaves the same variable (here 
Lung Cancer) by arrow heads. This means that the variable (here Lung 
Cancer) is a collider  in this path. Paths that have colliders in them are"
"closed  or inactive . Paths that do not are open  or active . Directed paths tell 
of causality, of causal chains. So, at the level of causality, we know, or 
assume, that smoking causes lung cancer and asbestos causes lung cancer."
"But we also know, or assume, that smoking does not cause expo sure to 
asbestos nor does exposure to asbestos cause smoking. At the level of 
statistics, we would expect there to be a correlation between smoking and"
"458 lung cancer and a correlation between asbestos and lung cancer, but no 
correlation between smoking and asbestos. Actually, where colliders are 
concerned again there is a little more to be said. To explain this, it is useful"
"to have different examples of colliders. The first is for a kitchen light. There 
is a door from outside to the kitchen, and a door from the kitchen to the 
rest of the interior of the house. Each of these doors has a kitchen light"
"switch near it. These switches turn the single kitchen light on or off : 
 
 
 
Figure 46. A Collider Between Two Switches and a Light . 
 
In the path Switch From Outside -> Kitchen Light < - Switch To 
Interior  there is a collider. There is causality, and correlations, between"
"the switches and the light, but not between the switches. Whether one 
switch is on (or off) is entirely independent of whether the other switch is 
on (or off). Looking at one of the switches alone will tell you nothing about"
"the other switch. But let us conditionalize on the Kitchen Light  i.e. permit 
information as to whether the light is on or off. Now there will be 
corr elation between the switches (e.g. if the light is on and one switch is off,"
"the other switch must be on, etc.). The second example is from Judea Pearl 
(who is the main modern theorist in this domain). It concerns a car that will 
not start. This may be because of a dead battery, or it may be because the 
car has no gas."
"459  
 
Figure 47. A Collider Between Possible Causes of a Car Not 
Starting . 
 
Dead Battery is entirely independent of No gas. But in the path Dead 
Battery -> Car Won't Start < - No gas , if we conditionalize on the 
variable Car Won't Start  then Dead Battery  becomes conditionally"
"dependent on No gas . For example, if you are told that the car won't start 
(i.e. that the value for the Car Won't Start  variable is True) then knowing 
that the battery is good tells you that the car does not have any gas. In sum"
"here, where there is a common effect, a collider, there is no correlation (or 
dependence) between the causes. But if the analysis conditions on the 
common effect there is conditional correlation (or conditional dependence)"
"between the causes . This  is called collider bias . It is worth mentioning 
because more than a few times in real research publications it happens by 
accident . Julia Rohrer mentions the following example. Say we are 
interested in whether rigorous research is correlated  with innovative"
"research — no causality being looked for here, just association — and we 
decide , being fancy,  to look at this question with published research being 
considered separately from unpublished research . But rigorous research"
"causes it to be published, and innovative research causes it to be published, 
so being published is a collider. Our conditioning on the collider may 
produce association out of thin air — collider bias (Rohrer 2018, 35) ."
"460  
Let us now briefly revisit the ordinary chain structure with one or more link 
or mediating variables. Say : 
 
 
Figure 48. A Chain From Smoking to Lung Cancer Mediated by 
Cell Mutation . 
 
As it stands there will be three dependencies or associations or correlations:"
"Smoking : Cell Mutation, Cell Mutation: Lung Cancer , Smoking : 
Lung Cancer . But consider what happens were we to conditionalize on 
the link variable, i.e. on Cell Mutation. Knowledge of a value for the cell 
mutation so -to-speak masks any values for the smoking variable as far as"
"predicting the lung cancer in concerned. Suppose the variable Cell 
Mutation  can have just two values: that there is mutation and that there is 
no mutation.  We know in general that smoking is associated with lung 
cancer. This means that in some cases varying whether there is smoking or"
"not brings about whether there is lung cancer or not. But is smoking 
associated with lung cancer when there definitely is cell mutation? The 
answer is 'No'. Varying the smoking has no effect on the cell mutation and it"
"is the cell mutation that is the direct cause of the lung cancer. It is similar 
for the other case where we fix the link value as being no mutation. In sum 
here, where there are link variables in a chain, there is correlation (or"
"dependence) between all the upstream variables of a chosen link, and the 
link, and all the downstream variables of the link. But if the analysis"
"461 conditions on the chosen link there is no conditional correlation (or 
conditional dependence) between all the upstream variables of a chosen 
link, and the link, and all the downstream variables of the link.  
 
The causal diagrams can be much more complicated than those displayed"
"here. Minimally there are diagrams like this : 
 
 
 
Figure 49. A Complex Interplay of Causes  Around Smoking . 
 
Lung cancer causes coughs. Asbestos causes lung cancer and, without 
causing lung cancer, causes coughs.  Smoking also causes coughs without"
"causing lung cancer. Smoking causes yellow fingers.  
 
The diagrams use arrows and these give a direction or flow to time and 
causality — which variables cause which other variables and which variables 
are 'earlier' than others. This brings another consideration into focus. No"
"variable can cause itself. This means that no directed path in a causal 
diagram (i.e. a path following the direction of the arrows) can go around in"
"462 a circle or 'cycle' and come back to an earlier variable. This means that the 
diagram, the graph structure as a whole, is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).  
 
Let us review the presentation. Causal diagrams can have two meanings or"
"functions: a data free explanation or description of the causes that are 
presumed to be at work, and a potentially data rich statistical description of 
the associations or dependencies or correlations. The causality has a 
direction (if smoking is the cause of lung cancer, lung cancer is not the"
"cause of smoking). The dependencies do not have directions (if smoking is 
associated with lung cancer, lung cancer is associated with smoking). 
Variables can be independent of each other. There is also the notion of 
conditional dependence and independence. The various structures of the"
"graphs (the chains, forks, and collisions) give rise to the various 
dependencies. They give rise to complex statistical predictions that can be 
tested. For example, the very simple causal diagram : 
 
 
 
Figure  50. A Chain From Smoking to Lung Cancer Mediated by 
Cell Mutation ."
"entails that smoking is correlated with lung cancer and not conditionally 
correlated with lung cancer when cell mutation is controlled for. If either of 
these statistical prediction are mistaken, so too is the original causal 
diagram."
"463  
There is a technique, in fact an algorithm, d-separation  ('direction 
separation') that can convert a causal diagram into all the statistical 
predictions that it entails.  
 
To sum up this whole presentation  in a simple way. If there are forks, there"
"needs to be conditionalization on the common causes. If there are 
collisions, there needs to be no conditionalization on the colliders.  
 
The importance of the causal diagrams is this. Almost all, maybe even all, 
machine learning is about what causes what — about learning about"
"causality. Machine learning, and all other kinds of empirical science  for that 
matter , never has anything more to work with than  correlations. They all 
have to make the leap from correlation to causation. There is no way this"
"can be done infallibly. There is no way it can be done without assumptions. 
But causal diagrams provide a framework for making assumptions and for 
suggesting the appropriate correlations to test.  
 
Let us conclude by sketch ing two examples of how causal diagrams might"
"be used in connection with bias. Matt Kusner et al. introduce the example 
of predicting the First Year Average Grade (FYA) of students in law school  
(Kusner et al. 2018) . They write : 
 
The Law School Admission Council conducted a survey across 163"
"law schools in the United States [35]. It contains information on 
21,790 law students such as their entrance exam scores (LSAT), 
their grade -point average (GPA) collected prior to law school, and 
their first year average grade (FYA)."
"464 Given this data, a school may wish to predict if an applicant will 
have a high FYA. The school would also like to make sure these 
predictions are not biased by an individual’s race and sex. 
However, the LSAT, GPA, and FYA scores, may be biased due to 
social factors.  (Kusner et al. 2018)"
"A causal diagram for this might be : 
 
 
Figure 51. Law School First Year Average Grade  (Kusner et al. 
2018) . 
 
This asserts that Race non -deterministically affects GPA, LSAT, and FYA, 
as does Sex. In this problem, it is imagined that the Law Schools want to"
"predict first year average grade FYA and they cannot use Race and Sex as 
these are protected.  The next step is to realize, or take into account, that 
knowledge, a student's knowledge , also affects GPA, LSAT, and FYA, and 
this gives a second causal diagram."
"465  
Figure 52. Law School First Year Average Grade  With Student 
Knowledge (Kusner et al. 2018) . 
 
With this causal diagram, some mathematics can be done on the forks, 
collisions , and the data, that can produce the requisite predictions of FYA"
"from LSAT and GPA without using the protected attributes of Race and Sex. 
The Law Schools would be able to prove the predicted FYA is not biased.  
 
Typically , the diagrams are more complex. This one from Tyler 
VanderWeele and Nancy Staudt  relates legal case s and the ir case"
"characteristics  to both judicial decisions and the likelihood that litigation 
will take place in courts with judges of a particular race, gender, age or 
ideology  (for plaintiffs  prefer  to file claims with judges deemed friendly to 
their legal claims ) (VanderWeele and Staudt 2011) ."
"466  
 
Figure 53. A Depiction of Possible Factors in a Judicial Decision 
(VanderWeele and Staudt 2011) . 
 
In sum.  If there is an assertion of bias, bias in allocation, say, perhaps with 
allocation of mortgages or allocation of places in a Law School. Suitable"
"causal diagrams might be able to  highlight  relevant correlations to be 
investigated. In turn, t hese might be able to produce evidence , within the 
bounds of fallibility, that there is no bias . The diagrams provide a structure"
"for investigation false positives and false negatives.  Separately, explainable 
artificial intelligence (XAI) is important. Explanations need causes. Causal 
diagrams are a steppingstone , along with data and correlations, towards 
identifying causes."

E.1 Knowledge Graphs  
 
A knowledge graph  is a means of representing knowledge. Its relevance to 
us is that is a technolog y or techniqu e that can help with the search and 
discovery of information. It is  not in itself an  artificial intelligence or"
"machine learning technique. However, it can be part of an infrastructure 
that supports some applications of machine learning in librarianship.  
 
Conceptually, a knowledge graph starts with a node  represent ing an object ,"
"which might be a person, a place, or a thing,  or a date, or etc. , then adds as 
links facts about that object . Here is a very simple knowledge graph :

Typical knowledge graphs will be much more complicated than this. Google 
have a knowledge graph technology , ‘Google Knowledge Graph’ . As of 2012 
this had 500 million objects and 3.4 billion facts in it  (Singhal 2012) ."
"Google populate their Knowledge Graph using search data that they have 
from users. For example, if the search ‘who painted the Mona Lisa?’ was 
popular, the answer to that search would be added to the knowledge graph 
as a fact."
"Usually, a knowledge graph is a data structure that computer programs can 
use in the background (as opposed to the user exploring it visually). No 
user is going to look through a graph of 500 million objects.  
 
Some possibilities for  knowledge graph s are:"
"1. Help ing disambiguate. For example, were there to be several ‘Bob’ 
objects in the graph, the user or system would know that 
disambiguation was required  for queries about ‘Bob’  and maybe 
suggest facts to do it.  
2. Help ing with creating summaries of information about an object."
"For example, it could help identify key facts  (say about the Mona 
Lisa).  
3. Pointing the user to further popular (or rare) queries or 
information about the objects.  
4. Being part of a question answering system (for example, who 
painted Mona Lisa ?)"
"470 5. Being part of a recommender system (for example, by extracting 
the preferences of similar people in the graph).

spam.  
2. In a  model that identifies dog breeds, some of the classes might 
be poodle,  beagle,  pug."
"475 classification model

counterfactual  
Let us start with an example. Napoleon lost the Battle of Waterloo, as a 
matter of fact. But an adventurous historian might consider the question of 
what would have happened if Napoleon had won the Battle of Waterloo."
"Supposing that Napoleon won would be counter -to-the-facts and the 
historian’s analysis would be a counterfactual analysis."
"477 Thinking counterfactually, which we do all the time, especially when 
making decisions, involves considering alternative scenarios and outcomes 
that did not  happen  or might not have happen ed but which could have 
happened under different circumstances. (If I’d run faster, I would have"
"caught the bus. If I’d studied harder , I would have passed the exam. If 
inflation had continued, there would have been a fall in unemployment. 
etc.)  Some counterfactuals are true, and some are false (for example, if the 
aforementioned bus were travelling at 50mph no amount of faster running"
"on my part would result in my catching it).  Counterfactual reasoning and 
causal reasoning are often intertwined. Were we to say ‘John Smith’s lung 
cancer was caused by smoking’ we in part mean ‘If John Smith had not 
smoked, he would not have got lung cancer’ (which is counterfactual)."
"Then, were we to say ‘If Jane Smith, a non -smoker, were to become a 
smoker, she would raise the probability of her getting lung cancer’, that 
statement is a true counterfactual supported by a causal connection 
between smoking and lung cancer.  Overall, counterfactuals are a valuable"
"tool in many fields for analyzing and understanding the implications of 
events and decisions by considering alternatives that did not occur.  
 
CPUs, GPUs, and CUDA® 
a CPU is a central processing unit, the main computing component of a"
"standard computer. A GPU is a graphics processing unit, a computing 
component originally designed to  provid e accelerated graphics  for video 
games and similar . Typically, a CPU works serially, one task after another, 
whereas a GPU works in parallel, carrying out many different tasks at the"
"same time. The company NVIDIA realized that GPUs, which they 
specialized in, were ideal for artificial intelligence. They produced the"
"478 CUDA® platform, which is for high performance, high throughput,

"479 delayed rewards  
in many settings there are rewards (such as passing the exam, arriving at 
the destination safely, finding the cheese in the maze.) Delayed rewards are 
where the agent has to do some exploring of the task  or making more than a"
"few steps presumably towards the goal, before a reward is given. The above 
examples have delayed rewards — pressing a button to get a pellet of food 
does not.  
 
digitization

processed by a computer."
"discriminative model  
predicts  the appropriate or correct labels  for new  examples  presented to it . 
For example, a discriminative model might predict whether incoming  email 
was spam. It discriminates between spam and not -spam. In contrast,"
"generative models might produce or create completely new examples such 
as new images or paintings. Most  supervised learning models  are 
discriminative models.

layer  
A set of  neurons  in a neural network. Three common types of layers are as 
follows:"
"1. The input layer, which provides values for all the  features.  
2. One or more  hidden layers, which find  relationships between the 
features and the label.  
3. The output layer, which provides the prediction.

"Markov (process or chain)  
a mathematical system that undergoes transitions from one state to 
another, with probabilistic rules that depend only on the current state and 
not on the sequence of events that preceded it. It is a memoryless model. It"

modality  
a high -level data category. For example, numbers, text, images, video, and 
audio are five different modalities.  
 
model  
any mathematical construct that processes input data and returns output. 
Phrased differently, a model is the set of parameters and structure needed"
"for a system to make predictions. In  supervised machine learning, a model 
is trained on labeled examples, then, in use, it takes an  unlabeled 
example  as input and infers a  prediction  of the correct label  as output."
"Unsupervised machine learning  also generates models, typically a function 
that can map an input example to the most appropriate  cluster  for it . 
 
N 
negative class  
in binary classification, one class is termed  positive  and the other is"
"termed  negative. The positive class is the thing or event that the model is 
testing for and the negative class is the other possibility. For example:  
 
1. The negative class in a medical test might be ‘not tumor. ’ 
2. The negative class in an email classifier might be ‘not spam. ’"
"neural network  
a model  containing at least one  hidden layer. A  deep neural network  is a 
type of neural network containing more than one hidden layer. For"
"491 example, the following diagram shows a deep neural network containing 
two hidden layers.

Each neuron in a neural network connects to all of the nodes in the next"
"layer. For example, in the preceding diagram, notice that each of the three 
neurons in the first hidden layer separately connect to both of the two 
neurons in the second hidden layer.  
Neural networks implemented on computers are sometimes called  artificial"
"neural networks  to differentiate them from neural networks found in brains 
and other biological nervous systems.  
Some neural networks can mimic extremely complex  relationships between 
different features and the label ."
"492 neuron  
In machine learning, a neuron is a distinct unit within a  hidden layer  of 
a neural network. Each neuron perform  does a calculation on its own inputs 
and decides whether it is activated i.e. whether it fires or is ‘triggered’."
"A neuron in the first hidden layer accepts inputs from the feature values in 
the input layer. A neuron in any hidden layer beyond the first accepts 
inputs from the neurons in the preceding hidden layer. For example, a 
neuron in the second hidden layer accepts inputs from the neurons in the"
"first hidden layer.

model might be ‘tumor. ’ The positive class in an email classifier might be"
‘spam. ’
"496 post -processing  
adjusting the output of a model  after  the model has been run. Post -
processing can be used to enforce fairness constraints without modifying 
models themselves.  For example, one might apply post -processing to a"

opportunity  is maintained for some attribute by checking that the  true 
positive rate  is the same for all values of that attribute.  As an example of"
"this, in a mortgage application program, post -processing might check that 
those living north of the railway tracks get as many mortgages as those 
living south of the railway tracks.  
precision  
Consider a search of a library collection for items that are relevant to that"
"search. Precision is the proportion, or percentage, of the returned items  
that are relevant. So, if everything returned is relevant, precision is 100%. If 
half the items returned are relevant, precision is 50%. Precision has a"
"companion property ‘recall’. Recall is the proportion, or percentage, of the 
relevant items in the collection  that are returned. If all the relevant items

retrieval -augmented generation  (RAG)  
is a technique to both to keep an LLM up to date with what it ‘knows’ and to 
be more accurate in its replies. The idea is to give the LLM access to an"
"external database or databases. Then factual prompt questions to the LLM 
are augmented with the instruction to check with the databases and find 
supporting facts, references, and citations. As external knowledge grows"
"there is no need to re -train the LLM. Rather, all that is required is for the

say for news articles).  
 
S

"T 
theory -laden  
observations, especially those using instruments, can be said to be theory -
laden and this means that they are influenced by  underlying theoretical 
framework s. For example, measuring the temperature of a medical patient"

about the expansion of mercury and glass.  That observations are theory -
laden does not mean that any or all of them are false or incorrect. It does,"
"however, mean that they are fallible (i.e. caution is needed, they might be 
mistaken ). 
 
token  
is used in two different ways. Were we to ask, how many letters are there 
printed below ? 
 
 t t t 
 
The answer ‘one’ would be talking of the letter tee as a type . Whereas the"
answer ‘three’ is talking of the tokens  of the letter tee. The second sense of
"503 ‘token’ concerns small processing units. For example, LLMs have a context 
window of text. That text consists of tokens, the chunks of text that the LLM 
looks at. Typically, tokens are larger than individually characters but 
smaller than whole words. So, a context window of 1000 tokens might"

class.  For example, the model infers that a particular email message is 
spam, and that email message really is spam.  
 
U 
underfitting"
"a model  with poor predictive ability caused by  the model not having  fully 
captured the complexity of the training data. Many problems can cause 
underfitting, including:  
1. Training on the wrong set of  features.  
2. Training for too few  epochs ."
3. Providing too few  hidden layers  in a deep neural network.

unfairness  
synonym for one meaning of bias.  
 
unlabeled example  
see example.  
 
unsupervised machine learning  
 
training a  model  to find patterns in a dataset, typically an unlabeled 
dataset.  The most common use of unsupervised machine learning is"
"to cluster  data into groups of similar examples. For example, an 
unsupervised machine learning algorithm can cluster songs based on 
various properties of the music. The resulting clusters can become an input 
to other machine learning algorithms (for example, to a music"
"recommendation service). Clustering can help when useful labels are scarce 
or absent. For example, in domains such as anti -abuse and fraud, clusters 
can help humans better understand the data.  
 
V 
validation  
 
the initial evaluation of a model's quality. Validation checks the quality of a"
"model's predictions against the  validation set.  Because the validation set 
differs from the  training set, validation helps guard against  overfitting.  
Evaluating the model against the validation set  can be thought of  as the"
"506 first round of testing and evaluating the model against the  test set  as the 
second round of testing.  
 
validation set  
 
the subset of the  dataset  that performs initial evaluation against a 
trained  model. Typically, you evaluate the trained model against"
"the validation set several times before evaluating the model against the  test 
set. 
Traditionally, you divide the examples in the dataset into the following 
three distinct subsets:  
1. a training set  
2. a validation set  
3. a test set"
"Ideally, each example in the dataset should belong to only one of the 
preceding subsets. For example, a single example should not belong to both 
the training set and the validation set.  
 
validity  
accuracy, correctness, or soundness. It concerns the extent to which a"
model or method accurately measures or predicts what it is intended to.
